<p><em>How do structured workflows transform machine learning development from ad-hoc experimentation into reliable, reproducible engineering processes?</em></p>
<p>Machine learning development often begins as exploratory data analysis and experimental model training, but production systems demand systematic, repeatable processes. Structured workflows transform this ad-hoc experimentation by establishing standardized stages for data collection, model development, validation, and deployment. These workflows address critical engineering challenges: ensuring data quality and consistency, managing model versioning and experimentation, automating testing and validation, and coordinating deployment across different environments. Systematic workflows enable teams to build reproducible systems, reduce development cycles, and maintain quality standards. This transformation from experimental prototyping to engineering discipline forms the operational backbone that supports reliable production deployments.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-ai-workflow-overview-97fb">Overview</h2>
<p>The machine learning lifecycle is a systematic, interconnected process that guides the transformation of raw data into actionable models deployed in real-world applications. Each stage builds upon the outcomes of the previous one, creating an iterative cycle of refinement and improvement that supports robust, scalable, and reliable systems.</p>
<p><a href="#fig-ml-lifecycle" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a> illustrates the lifecycle as a series of stages connected through continuous feedback loops. The process begins with data collection, which ensures a steady input of raw data from various sources. The collected data progresses to data ingestion, where it is prepared for downstream machine learning applications. Subsequently, data analysis and curation involve inspecting and selecting the most appropriate data for the task at hand. Following this, data labeling and data validation, which nowadays involves both humans and AI itself, ensure that the data is properly annotated and verified for usability before advancing further.</p>

<p>The data then enters the preparation stage, where it is transformed into machine learning-ready datasets through processes such as splitting and versioning. These datasets are used in the model training stage, where machine learning algorithms are applied to create predictive models. The resulting models are rigorously tested in the model evaluation stage, where performance metrics, such as key performance indicators (KPIs), are computed to assess reliability and effectiveness. Modern ML teams increasingly rely on experiment tracking systems<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> to manage the complexity of iterative model development and comparison. The validated models move to the ML system validation phase, where they are verified for deployment readiness. Once validated, these models are integrated into production systems during the ML system deployment stage, ensuring alignment with operational requirements. The final stage tracks the performance of deployed systems in real time, enabling continuous adaptation to new data and evolving conditions.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;<strong>Experiment Tracking Evolution</strong>: MLflow, open-sourced by Databricks in 2018, was one of the first comprehensive experiment tracking platforms, addressing the “ML experiment management crisis” where data scientists were losing track of model versions and results. Similar platforms like Weights &amp; Biases (2017) and Neptune (2019) emerged to solve what the industry calls “the reproducibility crisis”; studies found that only 15% of ML papers could be reproduced by other researchers, largely due to poor experiment tracking.</p></div></div><p>This general lifecycle forms the backbone of machine learning systems, with each stage contributing to the creation, validation, and maintenance of scalable and efficient solutions. While the lifecycle provides a detailed view of the interconnected processes in machine learning systems, it can be distilled into a simplified framework for practical implementation.</p>
<p>Each stage aligns with one of the following overarching categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Data Collection and Preparation</strong> ensures the availability of high-quality, representative datasets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Model Development and Training</strong> focuses on creating accurate and efficient models tailored to the problem at hand.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluation and Validation</strong> rigorously tests models to ensure reliability and robustness in real-world conditions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deployment and Integration</strong> translates models into production-ready systems that align with operational realities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Monitoring and Maintenance</strong> ensures ongoing system performance and adaptability in dynamic environments.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A defining feature of this framework is its iterative and dynamic nature. Feedback loops, such as those derived from monitoring that guide data collection improvements or deployment adjustments, ensure that machine learning systems maintain effectiveness and relevance over time. This adaptability is critical for addressing challenges such as shifting data distributions, operational constraints, and evolving user requirements. These challenges are compounded in production ML systems, where continuous integration and deployment practices<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> must account for both code changes and data evolution.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;<strong>CI/CD for Machine Learning</strong>: Traditional continuous integration assumes deterministic builds—the same code produces the same output. ML systems violate this assumption because model behavior depends on training data, random initialization, and hardware differences. Google’s TFX (TensorFlow Extended) and similar platforms had to reinvent CI/CD principles for ML, introducing concepts like “model validation” and “data validation” that have no equivalent in traditional software. Survey data shows that 78% of ML teams report that their traditional DevOps tools are inadequate for ML workflows.</p></div></div><p>By studying this framework, we establish a solid foundation for exploring specialized topics such as data engineering, model optimization, and deployment strategies in subsequent chapters. Viewing the ML lifecycle as an integrated and iterative process promotes a deeper understanding of how systems are designed, implemented, and maintained over time. To that end, this chapter focuses on the machine learning lifecycle as a systems-level framework, providing a high-level overview that bridges theoretical concepts with practical implementation. Through an examination of the lifecycle in its entirety, we gain insight into the interdependencies among its stages and the iterative processes that ensure long-term system scalability and relevance.</p>

<p>Rather than prescribing a fixed methodology, the ML lifecycle focuses on achieving specific objectives at each stage. This flexibility allows practitioners to adapt the process to the unique constraints and goals of individual projects. Typical stages include problem formulation, data acquisition and preprocessing, model development and training, evaluation, deployment, and ongoing optimization. Modern practitioners often use interactive development environments<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> that support this iterative, experimental approach to ML system development.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn4"><p><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;<strong>Jupyter Notebooks</strong>: Created by Fernando Pérez in 2001 as IPython, and later evolved into Project Jupyter in 2014. The name “Jupyter” comes from the core languages it supports: Julia, Python, and R. These notebooks revolutionized data science by allowing code, visualizations, and explanatory text in a single document, making the experimental nature of ML development more transparent and reproducible. Netflix estimates over 150,000 notebooks are created daily across the industry.</p></div></div><p>Although these stages may appear sequential, they are frequently revisited, creating a dynamic and interconnected process. The iterative nature of the lifecycle encourages feedback loops, whereby insights from later stages, including deployment, can inform earlier phases, including data preparation or model architecture design. This adaptability is essential for managing the uncertainties and complexities inherent in real-world ML applications.</p>
<p>From an instructional standpoint, the ML lifecycle provides a clear framework for organizing the study of machine learning systems. By decomposing the field into well-defined stages, students can engage more systematically with its core components. This structure mirrors industrial practice while supporting deeper conceptual understanding.</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish between the ML lifecycle and machine learning operations (MLOps), as the two are often conflated. The ML lifecycle, as presented in this chapter, emphasizes the stages and evolution of ML systems—the “what” and “why” of system development. In contrast, MLOps, which will be discussed in the <a href="../../../contents/core/ops/ops.html">MLOps Chapter</a>, addresses the “how,” focusing on tools, processes, and automation that support efficient implementation and maintenance. Introducing the lifecycle first provides a conceptual foundation for understanding the operational aspects that follow.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-ai-workflow-traditional-vs-ai-lifecycles-4f66">Traditional vs.&nbsp;AI Lifecycles</h3>
<p>Software development lifecycles have evolved through decades of engineering practice, establishing well-defined patterns for system development. Traditional lifecycles consist of sequential phases: requirements gathering, system design, implementation, testing, and deployment. Each phase produces specific artifacts that serve as inputs to subsequent phases. In financial software development, for instance, the requirements phase produces detailed specifications for transaction processing, security protocols, and regulatory compliance—specifications that directly translate into system behavior through explicit programming.</p>
<p>Machine learning systems require a fundamentally different approach to this traditional lifecycle model. The deterministic nature of conventional software, where behavior is explicitly programmed, contrasts sharply with the probabilistic nature of ML systems. Consider financial transaction processing: traditional systems follow predetermined rules (if account balance &gt; transaction amount, then allow transaction), while ML-based fraud detection systems learn to recognize suspicious patterns from historical transaction data. This shift from explicit programming to learned behavior significantly reshapes the development lifecycle.</p>
<p>The unique characteristics of machine learning systems, characterized by data dependency, probabilistic outputs, and evolving performance, introduce new dynamics that alter how lifecycle stages interact. These systems require ongoing refinement, with insights from later stages frequently feeding back into earlier ones. Unlike traditional systems, where lifecycle stages aim to produce stable outputs, machine learning systems are inherently dynamic and must adapt to changing data distributions and objectives.</p>
<p>The key distinctions are summarized in <a href="#tbl-sw-ml-cycles" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;1</a> below. These differences reflect the core challenge of working with data as a first-class citizen in system design, something traditional software engineering methodologies were not designed to handle<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>

Studies show that 87% of ML projects fail due to data issues, not algorithmic problems—highlighting why ML workflows must treat data with the same rigor as code.</p></div></div><div id="tbl-sw-ml-cycles" class="quarto-float quarto-figure quarto-figure-center anchored">

<p><strong>Problem Definition and Requirements</strong>: The first stage involves clearly defining the problem to be solved, establishing measurable performance objectives, and identifying key constraints. Precise problem definition ensures alignment between the system’s goals and the desired outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Data Collection and Preparation</strong>: This stage includes gathering relevant data, cleaning it, and preparing it for model training. This process often involves curating diverse datasets, ensuring high-quality labeling, and developing preprocessing pipelines to address variations in the data.</p>
<p><strong>Model Development and Training</strong>: In this stage, researchers select appropriate algorithms, design model architectures, and train models using the prepared data. Success depends on choosing techniques suited to the problem and iterating on the model design for optimal performance.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation and Validation</strong>: Evaluation involves rigorously testing the model’s performance against predefined metrics and validating its behavior in different scenarios. This stage ensures the model is not only accurate but also reliable and robust in real-world conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Deployment and Integration</strong>: Once validated, the trained model is integrated into production systems and workflows. This stage requires addressing practical challenges such as system compatibility, scalability, and operational constraints.</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring and Maintenance</strong>: The final stage focuses on continuously monitoring the system’s performance in real-world environments and maintaining or updating it as necessary. Effective monitoring ensures the system remains relevant and accurate over time, adapting to changes in data, requirements, or external conditions.</p>
<p><strong>A Case Study in Medical AI</strong>: To further ground our discussion on these stages, we will explore Google’s Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) screening project as a case study.

<p>On the surface, the goal appears straightforward: develop an AI system that could analyze retinal images and identify signs of DR with accuracy comparable to expert ophthalmologists. However, as the project progressed from research to real-world deployment, it revealed the complex challenges that characterize modern ML systems.</p>
<p>The initial results in controlled settings were promising. The system achieved performance comparable to expert ophthalmologists in detecting DR from high-quality retinal photographs. Yet, when the team attempted to deploy the system in rural clinics across Thailand and India (based on Google’s documented deployment experiences), they encountered a series of challenges that spanned the entire ML lifecycle, from data collection through deployment and maintenance. These deployment challenges reflect broader issues in healthcare AI<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> that affect most real-world medical ML applications.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-ai-workflow-problem-definition-87d9">Problem Definition</h2>
<p>The development of machine learning systems begins with a critical challenge that fundamentally differs from traditional software development: defining not just what the system should do, but how it should learn to do it. Unlike conventional software, where requirements directly translate into implementation rules, ML systems require teams to consider how the system will learn from data while operating within real-world constraints<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>. This stage lays the foundation for all subsequent phases in the ML lifecycle.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn8"><p><sup>8</sup>&nbsp;<strong>ML vs.&nbsp;Traditional Problem Definition</strong>: Traditional software problems are defined by deterministic specifications (“if input X, then output Y”), but ML problems are defined by examples and desired behaviors. This shift means that 73% of ML project failures occur during problem definition, compared to only 32% for traditional software. The challenge lies in translating business objectives into learning objectives—something that didn’t exist in software engineering until the rise of data-driven systems in the 2000s.</p></div></div><p>In our case study, diabetic retinopathy is a problem that blends technical complexity with global healthcare implications. With 415 million diabetic patients at risk of blindness worldwide and limited access to specialists in underserved regions, defining the problem required balancing technical goals, such as expert-level diagnostic accuracy, with practical constraints. The system needed to prioritize cases for early intervention while operating effectively in resource-limited settings. These constraints showcased how problem definition must integrate learning capabilities with operational needs to deliver actionable and sustainable solutions.</p>
<section id="sec-ai-workflow-requirements-system-impact-db7f" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-ai-workflow-requirements-system-impact-db7f">Requirements and System Impact</h3>
<p>Defining an ML problem involves more than specifying desired performance metrics. It requires a deep understanding of the broader context in which the system will operate. For instance, developing a system to detect DR with expert-level accuracy might initially appear to be a straightforward classification task. After all, one might assume that training a model on a sufficiently large dataset of labeled retinal images and evaluating its performance against standard metrics would suffice.</p>
<p>However, real-world challenges complicate this picture. ML systems must function effectively in diverse environments, where factors like computational constraints, data variability, and integration requirements play significant roles. For example, the DR system needed to detect subtle features like microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and hard exudates across retinal images of varying quality while operating within the limitations of hardware in rural clinics. A model that performs well in isolation may falter if it cannot handle operational realities, such as inconsistent imaging conditions or time-sensitive clinical workflows. Addressing these factors requires aligning learning objectives with system constraints, ensuring the system’s long-term viability in its intended context.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-ai-workflow-definition-workflow-baa6" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-ai-workflow-definition-workflow-baa6">Definition Workflow</h3>
<p>Establishing clear and actionable problem definitions involves a multi-step workflow that bridges technical, operational, and user considerations. The process begins with identifying the core objective of the system—what tasks it must perform and what constraints it must satisfy. Teams collaborate with stakeholders to gather domain knowledge, outline requirements, and anticipate challenges that may arise in real-world deployment.</p>
<p>In the DR project, this phase involved close collaboration with clinicians to determine the diagnostic needs of rural clinics. Key decisions, such as balancing model complexity with hardware limitations and ensuring interpretability for healthcare providers, were made during this phase. The team’s iterative approach also accounted for regulatory considerations, such as patient privacy and compliance with healthcare standards. This collaborative process ensured that the problem definition aligned with both technical feasibility and clinical relevance.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-ai-workflow-scale-distribution-e38e" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-ai-workflow-scale-distribution-e38e">Scale and Distribution</h3>
<p>As ML systems scale, their problem definitions must adapt to new operational challenges. For example, the DR project initially focused on a limited number of clinics with consistent imaging setups. However, as the system expanded to include clinics with varying equipment, staff expertise, and patient demographics, the original problem definition required adjustments to accommodate these variations.</p>
<p>Scaling also introduces data challenges. Larger datasets may include more diverse edge cases, which can expose weaknesses in the initial model design. In the DR project, for instance, expanding the deployment to new regions introduced variations in imaging equipment and patient populations that required further tuning of the system. Defining a problem that accommodates such diversity from the outset ensures the system can handle future expansion without requiring a complete redesign.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-ai-workflow-systems-thinking-24d3" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-ai-workflow-systems-thinking-24d3">Systems Thinking</h3>
<p>Problem definition, viewed through a systems lens, connects deeply with every stage of the ML lifecycle. Choices made during this phase shape how data is collected, how models are developed, and how systems are deployed and maintained. A poorly defined problem can lead to inefficiencies or failures in later stages, emphasizing the need for a holistic perspective.</p>
<p>Feedback loops are central to effective problem definition. As the system evolves, real-world feedback from deployment and monitoring often reveals new constraints or requirements that necessitate revisiting the problem definition. For example, feedback from clinicians about system usability or patient outcomes may guide refinements in the original goals. In the DR project, the need for interpretable outputs that clinicians could trust and act upon influenced both model development and deployment strategies.</p>
<p>Emergent behaviors also play a role. A system that was initially designed to detect retinopathy might reveal additional use cases, such as identifying other conditions like diabetic macular edema, which can reshape the problem’s scope and requirements. In the DR project, insights from deployment highlighted potential extensions to other imaging modalities, such as Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).</p>
<p>Resource dependencies further highlight the interconnectedness of problem definition. Decisions about model complexity, for instance, directly affect infrastructure needs, data collection strategies, and deployment feasibility. Balancing these dependencies requires careful planning during the problem definition phase, ensuring that early decisions do not create bottlenecks in later stages.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-ai-workflow-lifecycle-implications-5cef" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-ai-workflow-lifecycle-implications-5cef">Lifecycle Implications</h3>
<p>The problem definition phase is foundational, influencing every subsequent stage of the lifecycle. A well-defined problem ensures that data collection focuses on the most relevant features, that models are developed with the right constraints in mind, and that deployment strategies align with operational realities.</p>
<p>In the DR project, defining the problem with scalability and adaptability in mind enabled the team to anticipate future challenges, such as accommodating new imaging devices or expanding to additional clinics. For instance, early considerations of diverse imaging conditions and patient demographics reduced the need for costly redesigns later in the lifecycle. This forward-thinking approach ensured the system’s long-term success and adaptability in dynamic healthcare environments.</p>
<p>By embedding lifecycle thinking into problem definition, teams can create systems that not only meet initial requirements but also adapt and evolve in response to changing conditions. This ensures that ML systems remain effective, scalable, and impactful over time.</p>

<section id="sec-ai-workflow-data-collection-ab2c" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-ai-workflow-data-collection-ab2c">Data Collection</h2>
<p>Data is the foundation of machine learning systems, yet collecting and preparing data for ML applications introduces challenges that extend far beyond gathering enough training examples. Modern ML systems often need to handle terabytes of data, which range from raw, unstructured inputs to carefully annotated datasets, while maintaining quality, diversity, and relevance for model training. For medical systems like DR screening, data preparation must meet the highest standards to ensure diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p>In the DR project, data collection involved a development dataset of 128,000 retinal fundus photographs evaluated by a panel of 54 ophthalmologists, with each image reviewed by 3-7 experts<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>. This collaborative effort ensured high-quality labels that captured clinically relevant features like microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and hard exudates. Additionally, clinical validation datasets comprising 12,000 images provided an independent benchmark to test the model’s robustness against real-world variability, illustrating the importance of rigorous and representative data collection. The scale and complexity of this effort highlight how domain expertise and interdisciplinary collaboration are critical to building datasets for high-stakes ML systems.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn9"><p><sup>9</sup>&nbsp;<strong>Medical Data Annotation Costs</strong>: Expert medical annotation is extraordinarily expensive—ophthalmologists charge $200-500 per hour, meaning the DR dataset’s annotation cost exceeded $2.7 million in expert time alone. This represents one of the highest annotation costs per sample in ML history. For comparison, ImageNet’s 14 million images cost approximately $50,000 to annotate using crowdsourcing, while medical datasets can cost 100-1000x more per image. This cost disparity explains why medical AI often relies on transfer learning and why synthetic data generation is becoming crucial for healthcare applications.</p></div></div><section id="sec-ai-workflow-data-requirements-impact-6975" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-ai-workflow-data-requirements-impact-6975">Data Requirements and Impact</h3>
<p>The requirements for data collection and preparation emerge from the dual perspectives of machine learning and operational constraints. In the DR project, high-quality retinal images annotated by experts were a foundational need to train accurate models. However, real-world conditions quickly revealed additional complexities. Images were collected from rural clinics using different camera equipment, operated by staff with varying levels of expertise, and often under conditions of limited network connectivity.</p>
<p>These operational realities shaped the system architecture in significant ways. The volume and size of high-resolution images necessitated local storage and preprocessing capabilities at clinics, as centralizing all data collection was impractical due to unreliable internet access. Furthermore, patient privacy regulations required secure data handling at every stage, from image capture to model training<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>. Coordinating expert annotations also introduced logistical challenges, necessitating systems that could bridge the physical distance between clinics and ophthalmologists while maintaining workflow efficiency.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn10"><p><sup>10</sup>&nbsp;<strong>Medical AI Privacy Complexity</strong>: Healthcare data crosses jurisdictional boundaries with different privacy laws—HIPAA in the US, GDPR in Europe, and various national regulations elsewhere. Medical AI systems must implement techniques like differential privacy, federated learning, and homomorphic encryption, adding 40-60% to development costs. The “data cannot leave the country” requirements in many regions have led to the rise of federated learning architectures, where models travel to data rather than data traveling to models—a paradigm shift that Google’s DR project helped establish in healthcare AI.</p></div></div><p>These considerations demonstrate how data collection requirements influence the entire ML lifecycle. Infrastructure design, annotation pipelines, and privacy protocols all play critical roles in ensuring that collected data aligns with both technical and operational goals.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-ai-workflow-data-infrastructure-5088" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-ai-workflow-data-infrastructure-5088">Data Infrastructure</h3>
<p>The flow of data through the system highlights critical infrastructure requirements at every stage. In the DR project, the journey of a single retinal image offers a glimpse into these complexities. From its capture on a retinal camera, where image quality is paramount, the data moves through local clinic systems for initial storage and preprocessing. Eventually, it must reach central systems where it is aggregated with data from other clinics for model training and validation.</p>
<p>At each step, the system must balance local needs with centralized aggregation requirements. Clinics with reliable high-speed internet could transmit data in real-time, but many rural locations relied on store-and-forward systems, where data was queued locally and transmitted in bulk when connectivity permitted. These differences necessitated flexible infrastructure that could adapt to varying conditions while maintaining data consistency and integrity across the lifecycle. This adaptability ensured that the system could function reliably despite the diverse operational environments of the clinics.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-ai-workflow-scale-distribution-7fc8" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-ai-workflow-scale-distribution-7fc8">Scale and Distribution</h3>
<p>As ML systems scale, the challenges of data collection grow exponentially. In the DR project, scaling from an initial few clinics to a broader network introduced significant variability in equipment, workflows, and operating conditions. Each clinic effectively became an independent data node, yet the system needed to ensure consistent performance and reliability across all locations.</p>
<p>This scaling effort also brought increasing data volumes, as higher-resolution imaging devices became standard, generating larger and more detailed images. These advances amplified the demands on storage and processing infrastructure, requiring optimizations to maintain efficiency without compromising quality. Differences in patient demographics, clinic workflows, and connectivity patterns further underscored the need for robust design to handle these variations gracefully.</p>
<p>Scaling challenges highlight how decisions made during the data collection phase ripple through the lifecycle, impacting subsequent stages like model development, deployment, and monitoring. For instance, accommodating higher-resolution data during collection directly influences computational requirements for training and inference, emphasizing the need for lifecycle thinking even at this early stage.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-ai-workflow-data-validation-5359" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-ai-workflow-data-validation-5359">Data Validation</h3>
<p>Quality assurance is an integral part of the data collection process, ensuring that data meets the requirements for downstream stages. In the DR project, automated checks at the point of collection flagged issues like poor focus or incorrect framing, allowing clinic staff to address problems immediately. These proactive measures ensured that low-quality data was not propagated through the pipeline.</p>
<p>Validation systems extended these efforts by verifying not just image quality but also proper labeling, patient association, and compliance with privacy regulations. Operating at both local and centralized levels, these systems ensured data reliability and robustness, safeguarding the integrity of the entire ML pipeline.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-ai-workflow-systems-thinking-0dca">Systems Thinking</h3>
<p>Viewing data collection and preparation through a lifecycle lens reveals the interconnected nature of these processes. Each decision made during this phase influences subsequent stages of the ML system. For instance, choices about camera equipment and image preprocessing affect not only the quality of the training dataset but also the computational requirements for model development and the accuracy of predictions during deployment.</p>
<p><a href="#fig-ml-lifecycle-feedback" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;4</a> illustrates the key feedback loops that characterize the ML lifecycle, with particular relevance to data collection and preparation. Looking at the left side of the diagram, we see how monitoring and maintenance activities feed back to both data collection and preparation stages. For example, when monitoring reveals data quality issues in production (shown by the “Data Quality Issues” feedback arrow), this triggers refinements in our data preparation pipelines. Similarly, performance insights from deployment might highlight gaps in our training data distribution (indicated by the “Performance Insights” loop back to data collection), prompting the collection of additional data to cover underrepresented cases. In the DR project, this manifested when monitoring revealed that certain demographic groups were underrepresented in the training data, leading to targeted data collection efforts to improve model fairness and accuracy across all populations.</p>

<p>Feedback loops are another critical aspect of this lifecycle perspective. Insights from model performance often lead to adjustments in data collection strategies, creating an iterative improvement process. For example, in the DR project, patterns observed during model evaluation influenced updates to preprocessing pipelines, ensuring that new data aligned with the system’s evolving requirements.</p>
<p>The scaling of data collection introduces emergent behaviors that must be managed holistically. While individual clinics may function well in isolation, the simultaneous operation of multiple clinics can lead to system-wide patterns like network congestion or storage bottlenecks. These behaviors reinforce the importance of considering data collection as a system-level challenge rather than a discrete, isolated task.</p>
<p>In the following chapters, we will step through each of the major stages of the lifecycle shown in <a href="#fig-ml-lifecycle-feedback" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;4</a>. We will consider several key questions like what influences data source selection, how feedback loops can be systematically incorporated, and how emergent behaviors can be anticipated and managed holistically.</p>
<p>In addition, by adopting a systems thinking approach, we emphasize the iterative and interconnected nature of the ML lifecycle. How do choices in data collection and preparation ripple through the entire pipeline? What mechanisms ensure that monitoring insights and performance evaluations effectively inform improvements at earlier stages? And how can governance frameworks and infrastructure design evolve to meet the challenges of scaling while maintaining fairness and efficiency? These questions will guide our exploration of the lifecycle, offering a foundation for designing robust and adaptive ML systems.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-ai-workflow-model-development-dfdc">Model Development</h2>
<p>Model development and training form the core of machine learning systems, yet this stage presents unique challenges that extend far beyond selecting algorithms and tuning hyperparameters. It involves designing architectures suited to the problem, optimizing for computational efficiency, and iterating on models to balance performance with deployability. In high-stakes domains like healthcare, the stakes are particularly high, as every design decision impacts clinical outcomes.</p>
<p>For DR detection, the model needed to achieve expert-level accuracy while handling the high resolution and variability of retinal images. Using a machine learning model trained on their meticulously labeled dataset, the team achieved an F-score of 0.95, slightly exceeding the median score of the consulted ophthalmologists (0.91). This outcome highlights the effectiveness of advanced machine learning approaches<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> and the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration between data scientists and medical experts to refine features and interpret model outputs.</p>

Introduced by Yann LeCun’s team in the 1990s and popularized by the 2014 ImageNet competition, transfer learning became the foundation for most practical computer vision applications. Instead of training from scratch, practitioners can achieve expert-level performance with thousands rather than millions of training examples.</p></div></div><section id="sec-ai-workflow-model-requirements-impact-6470" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-ai-workflow-model-requirements-impact-6470">Model Requirements and Impact</h3>
<p>The requirements for model development emerge not only from the specific learning task but also from broader system constraints. In the DR project, the model needed high sensitivity and specificity to detect different stages of retinopathy. However, achieving this purely from an ML perspective was not sufficient. The system had to meet operational constraints, including running on limited hardware in rural clinics, producing results quickly enough to fit into clinical workflows, and being interpretable enough for healthcare providers to trust its outputs.</p>
<p>These requirements shaped decisions during model development. While state-of-the-art accuracy might favor the largest and most complex models, such approaches were infeasible given hardware and workflow constraints. The team focused on designing architectures that balanced accuracy with efficiency, exploring lightweight models that could perform well on constrained devices. For example, model optimization techniques were employed to optimize the models for resource-limited environments, ensuring compatibility with rural clinic infrastructure.</p>
<p>This balancing act influenced every part of the system lifecycle. Decisions about model architecture affected data preprocessing, shaped the training infrastructure, and determined deployment strategies. For example, choosing to use multiple smaller models instead of a single large model altered data processing during training, required changes to inference pipelines, and introduced complexities in how model updates were managed in production.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-ai-workflow-deployment-2839">Deployment</h2>
<p>Once validated, the trained model is integrated into production systems and workflows. Deployment requires addressing practical challenges such as system compatibility, scalability, and operational constraints. Successful integration hinges on ensuring that the model’s predictions are not only accurate but also actionable in real-world settings, where resource limitations and workflow disruptions can pose significant barriers.</p>
<p>In the DR project, deployment strategies were shaped by the diverse environments in which the system would operate. Edge deployment enabled local processing of retinal images in rural clinics with intermittent connectivity, while automated quality checks flagged poor-quality images for recapture, ensuring reliable predictions. These measures demonstrate how deployment must bridge technological sophistication with usability and scalability across varied clinical settings.</p>
<section id="sec-ai-workflow-deployment-requirements-impact-2ef2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-ai-workflow-deployment-requirements-impact-2ef2">Deployment Requirements and Impact</h3>
<p>The requirements for deployment stem from both the technical specifications of the model and the operational constraints of its intended environment. In the DR project, the model needed to operate in rural clinics with limited computational resources and intermittent internet connectivity. Additionally, it had to fit seamlessly into the existing clinical workflow, which required rapid, interpretable results that could assist healthcare providers without causing disruption.</p>
<p>These requirements influenced deployment strategies significantly. A cloud-based deployment, while technically simpler, was not feasible due to unreliable connectivity in many clinics. Instead, the team opted for edge deployment, where models ran locally on clinic hardware. This approach required optimizing the model for smaller, less powerful devices while maintaining high accuracy. Model optimization techniques were employed to reduce resource demands without sacrificing performance.</p>
<p>Integration with existing systems posed additional challenges. The ML system had to interface with hospital information systems (HIS) for accessing patient records and storing results. Privacy regulations mandated secure data handling at every step, further shaping deployment decisions. These considerations ensured that the system adhered to clinical and legal standards while remaining practical for daily use.</p>

<section id="sec-ai-workflow-scale-distribution-86c2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-ai-workflow-scale-distribution-86c2">Scale and Distribution</h3>
<p>Scaling deployment across multiple locations introduced new complexities. Each clinic had unique infrastructure, ranging from differences in imaging equipment to variations in network reliability. These differences necessitated flexible deployment strategies that could adapt to diverse environments while ensuring consistent performance.</p>
<p>Despite achieving high performance metrics during development, the DR system faced unexpected challenges in real-world deployment. For example, in rural clinics, variations in imaging equipment and operator expertise led to inconsistencies in image quality that the model struggled to handle. These issues underscored the gap between laboratory success and operational reliability, prompting iterative refinements in both the model and the deployment strategy. Feedback from clinicians further revealed that initial system interfaces were not intuitive enough for widespread adoption, leading to additional redesigns.</p>
<p>Distribution challenges extended beyond infrastructure variability. The team needed to maintain synchronized updates across all deployment sites to ensure that improvements in model performance or system features were universally applied. This required implementing centralized version control systems and automated update pipelines that minimized disruption to clinical operations.</p>
<p>Despite achieving high performance metrics during development, the DR system faced unexpected challenges in real-world deployment. As illustrated in <a href="#fig-ml-lifecycle-feedback" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;4</a>, these challenges create multiple feedback paths—“Deployment Constraints” flowing back to model training to trigger optimizations, while “Performance Insights” from monitoring could necessitate new data collection. For example, when the system struggled with images from older camera models, this triggered both model optimizations and targeted data collection to improve performance under these conditions.</p>
<p>Another critical scaling challenge was training and supporting end-users. Clinicians and staff needed to understand how to operate the system, interpret its outputs, and provide feedback. The team developed comprehensive training programs and support channels to facilitate this transition, recognizing that user trust and proficiency were essential for system adoption.</p>

<p>The AI workflow we’ve explored, while illustrated through the Diabetic Retinopathy project, represents a framework applicable across diverse domains of AI application. From finance and manufacturing to environmental monitoring and autonomous vehicles, the core stages of the workflow remain consistent, even as their specific implementations vary widely.</p>
<p>The interconnected nature of the AI lifecycle, illustrated in <a href="#fig-ml-lifecycle-feedback" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;4</a>, is a universal constant. The feedback loops, from “Performance Insights” driving data collection to “Validation Issues” triggering model updates, demonstrate how decisions in one stage invariably impact others. Data quality affects model performance, deployment constraints influence architecture choices, and real-world usage patterns drive ongoing refinement through these well-defined feedback paths.</p>
<p>Regardless of the application, the interconnected nature of the AI lifecycle is a universal constant. Whether developing fraud detection systems for banks or predictive maintenance models for industrial equipment, decisions made in one stage invariably impact others.

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn15"><p><sup>15</sup>&nbsp;<strong>Systems Thinking in AI</strong>: The concept of “systems thinking” originated with biologist Ludwig von Bertalanffy in the 1940s and was later applied to engineering by Jay Forrester at MIT in the 1950s. Its application to AI became critical around 2018 when companies realized that optimizing individual ML models wasn’t enough—success required optimizing the entire ML pipeline. This shift explains why “ML systems engineering” emerged as a distinct discipline, separate from both traditional software engineering and machine learning research, with its own conferences (MLSys, first held in 2020) and academic programs.</p></div></div><p>As AI continues to evolve and expand into new areas, this holistic approach becomes increasingly crucial. Future challenges in AI development, whether in healthcare, finance, environmental science, or any other field, will likely center around managing increased complexity, ensuring adaptability, and balancing performance with ethical considerations.
