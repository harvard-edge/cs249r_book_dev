<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p><em>Why do privacy and security determine whether machine learning systems achieve widespread adoption and societal trust?</em></p>
<p>Machine learning systems require unprecedented access to personal data, institutional knowledge, and behavioral patterns to function effectively, creating tension between utility and protection that determines societal acceptance. Unlike traditional software that processes data transiently, ML systems learn from sensitive information and embed patterns into persistent models that can inadvertently reveal private details. This capability creates systemic risks extending beyond individual privacy violations to threaten institutional trust, competitive advantages, and democratic governance. Success of machine learning deployment across critical domains (healthcare, finance, education, and public services) depends entirely on establishing robust security and privacy foundations enabling beneficial use while preventing harmful exposure. Without these protections, even the most capable systems remain unused due to legal, ethical, and practical concerns. Understanding privacy and security principles enables engineers to design systems achieving both technical excellence and societal acceptance.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-security-privacy-ml-systems-0b1e">Security and Privacy in ML Systems</h2>
<p>The shift from centralized training architectures to distributed, adaptive machine learning systems has altered the threat landscape and security requirements for modern ML infrastructure. Contemporary machine learning systems, as examined in <strong><a href="../ondevice_learning/ondevice_learning.html#sec-ondevice-learning">Chapter 14: On-Device Learning</a></strong>, increasingly operate across heterogeneous computational environments spanning edge devices, federated networks, and hybrid cloud deployments. This architectural evolution enables new capabilities in adaptive intelligence but introduces attack vectors and privacy vulnerabilities that traditional cybersecurity frameworks cannot adequately address.</p>
<p>Machine learning systems exhibit different security characteristics compared to conventional software applications. Traditional software systems process data transiently and deterministically, whereas machine learning systems extract and encode patterns from training data into persistent model parameters. This learned knowledge representation creates unique vulnerabilities where sensitive information can be inadvertently memorized and later exposed through model outputs or systematic interrogation. Such risks manifest across domains from healthcare systems that may leak patient information to proprietary models that can be reverse-engineered through strategic query patterns, threatening both individual privacy and organizational intellectual property.</p>
<p>The architectural complexity of machine learning systems, as detailed in <strong><a href="../ml_systems/ml_systems.html#sec-ml-systems">Chapter 2: ML Systems</a></strong>, compounds these security challenges through multi-layered attack surfaces. Contemporary ML deployments include data ingestion pipelines, distributed training infrastructure, model serving systems, and continuous monitoring frameworks. Each architectural component introduces distinct vulnerabilities while privacy concerns affect the entire computational stack. The distributed nature of modern deployments, with continuous adaptation at edge nodes and federated coordination protocols, expands the attack surface while complicating comprehensive security implementation.</p>
<p>Addressing these challenges requires systematic approaches that integrate security and privacy considerations throughout the machine learning system lifecycle. This chapter establishes the foundations and methodologies necessary for engineering ML systems that achieve both computational effectiveness and trustworthy operation. We examine the application of established security principles to machine learning contexts, identify threat models specific to learning systems, and present comprehensive defense strategies that include data protection mechanisms, secure model architectures, and hardware-based security implementations.</p>
<p>Our investigation proceeds through four interconnected frameworks. We begin by establishing distinctions between security and privacy within machine learning contexts, then examine evidence from historical security incidents to inform contemporary threat assessment. We analyze vulnerabilities that emerge from the learning process itself, before presenting layered defense architectures that span cryptographic data protection, adversarial-robust model design, and hardware security mechanisms. Throughout this analysis, we emphasize implementation guidance that enables practitioners to develop systems meeting both technical performance requirements and the trust standards necessary for societal deployment.</p>

<p>Security and privacy are core concerns in machine learning system design, but they are often misunderstood or conflated. Both aim to protect systems and data, yet they do so in different ways, address different threat models, and require distinct technical responses. For ML systems, distinguishing between the two helps guide the design of robust and responsible infrastructure.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-security-defined-1129">Security Defined</h3>
<p>Security in machine learning focuses on defending systems from adversarial behavior. This includes protecting model parameters, training pipelines, deployment infrastructure, and data access pathways from manipulation or misuse.</p>
<div id="callout-definition*-1.1" class="callout callout-definition" title="Security Definition">
<p></p><details class="callout-definition fbx-default closebutton" open=""><summary><strong>Definition: </strong>Security Definition</summary><div><strong><em>Security</em></strong> in machine learning systems is the <em>protection of data, models, and infrastructure</em> from <em>unauthorized access</em>, <em>manipulation</em>, or <em>disruption</em>. It spans the <em>design and implementation</em> of <em>defensive mechanisms</em> that protect against <em>data poisoning</em>, <em>model theft</em>, <em>adversarial manipulation</em>, and <em>system-level vulnerabilities</em>.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-privacy-defined-da84">Privacy Defined</h3>
<p>While security addresses adversarial threats, privacy focuses on limiting the exposure and misuse of sensitive information within ML systems. This includes protecting training data, inference inputs, and model outputs from leaking personal or proprietary information, even when systems operate correctly and no explicit attack is taking place.</p>
<div id="callout-definition*-1.2" class="callout callout-definition" title="Privacy Definition">

<p>Security and privacy are deeply interrelated but not interchangeable. A secure system helps maintain privacy by restricting unauthorized access to models and data. Privacy-preserving designs can improve security by reducing the attack surface, for example, minimizing the retention of sensitive data reduces the risk of exposure if a system is compromised.</p>
<p>However, they can also be in tension. Techniques like differential privacy<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> reduce memorization risks but may lower model utility. Similarly, encryption enhances security but may obscure transparency and auditability, complicating privacy compliance. In machine learning systems, designers must reason about these trade-offs holistically. Systems that serve sensitive domains, including healthcare, finance, and public safety, must simultaneously protect against both misuse (security) and overexposure (privacy). Understanding the boundaries between these concerns is essential for building systems that are performant, trustworthy, and legally compliant.</p>

<p>Having established the conceptual foundations of security and privacy, we now examine how these principles manifest in real-world systems through landmark security incidents.

More importantly, they reveal universal patterns (supply chain compromise, insufficient isolation, and weaponized endpoints) that directly apply to modern machine learning deployments.</p>
<p>Valuable lessons can be drawn from well-known security breaches across a range of computing systems. Understanding how these patterns apply to modern ML deployments, which increasingly operate across cloud, edge, and embedded environments, provides important lessons for securing machine learning systems. These incidents demonstrate how weaknesses in system design can lead to widespread, and sometimes physical, consequences. Although the examples discussed in this section do not all involve machine learning directly, they provide important insights into designing secure systems.

<p>In 2010, security researchers discovered a highly sophisticated computer worm later named <a href="https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/200661/Cyber-Reports-2017-04.pdf">Stuxnet</a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, which targeted industrial control systems used in Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility <span class="citation" data-cites="farwell2011stuxnet">(<a href="#ref-farwell2011stuxnet" role="doc-biblioref">Farwell and Rohozinski 2011</a>)</span>.

</div></div></div><p>Unlike typical malware designed to steal information or perform espionage, Stuxnet was engineered to cause physical damage. Its objective was to disrupt uranium enrichment by sabotaging the centrifuges used in the process. Despite the facility being air-gapped<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> from external networks, the malware is believed to have entered the system via an infected USB device<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>, demonstrating how physical access can compromise isolated environments.</p>
<p>The worm specifically targeted programmable logic controllers (PLCs), industrial computers that automate electromechanical processes such as controlling the speed of centrifuges. By exploiting vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system and the Siemens Step7 software used to program the PLCs, Stuxnet achieved highly targeted, real-world disruption. This represents a landmark in cybersecurity, demonstrating how malicious software can bridge the digital and physical worlds to manipulate industrial infrastructure.</p>
<p>The lessons from Stuxnet directly apply to modern ML systems. Training pipelines and model repositories face persistent supply chain risks analogous to those exploited by Stuxnet. Just as Stuxnet compromised industrial systems through infected USB devices and software vulnerabilities, modern ML systems face multiple attack vectors: compromised dependencies (malicious packages in PyPI/conda repositories), malicious training data (poisoned datasets on HuggingFace, Kaggle), backdoored model weights (trojan models in model repositories), and tampered hardware drivers (compromised NVIDIA CUDA libraries, firmware backdoors in AI accelerators).</p>
<p>A concrete ML attack scenario illustrates these risks: an attacker uploads a backdoored image classification model to a popular model repository, trained to misclassify specific patterns while maintaining normal accuracy on clean data. When deployed in autonomous vehicles, this backdoored model correctly identifies most objects but fails to detect pedestrians wearing specific patterns, creating safety risks. The attack propagates through automated model deployment pipelines, affecting thousands of vehicles before detection.</p>
<p>Defending against such supply chain attacks requires end-to-end security measures: (1) cryptographic verification to sign all model artifacts, datasets, and dependencies with cryptographic signatures; (2) provenance tracking to maintain immutable logs of all training data sources, code versions, and infrastructure used; (3) integrity validation to implement automated scanning for model backdoors, dependency vulnerabilities, and dataset poisoning before deployment; (4) air-gapped training to isolate sensitive model training in secure environments with controlled dependency management. <a href="#fig-stuxnet" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a> illustrates how these supply chain compromise patterns apply across both industrial and ML systems.</p>

<p>The 2015 Jeep Cherokee hack demonstrated how connectivity in everyday products creates new vulnerabilities. Security researchers publicly demonstrated a remote cyberattack on a Jeep Cherokee that exposed important vulnerabilities in automotive system design <span class="citation" data-cites="miller2015remote miller2019lessons">(<a href="#ref-miller2015remote" role="doc-biblioref">Miller and Valasek 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-miller2019lessons" role="doc-biblioref">Miller 2019</a>)</span>. Conducted as a controlled experiment, the researchers exploited a vulnerability in the vehicle’s Uconnect entertainment system, which was connected to the internet via a cellular network. By gaining remote access to this system, they sent commands that affected the vehicle’s engine, transmission, and braking systems without physical access to the car.</p>

</div></div><p>This demonstration served as a wake-up call for the automotive industry, highlighting the risks posed by the growing connectivity of modern vehicles. Traditionally isolated automotive control systems, such as those managing steering and braking, were shown to be vulnerable when exposed through externally accessible software interfaces. The ability to remotely manipulate safety-critical functions raised serious concerns about passenger safety, regulatory oversight, and industry best practices.</p>
<p>The incident also led to a recall of over 1.4 million vehicles to patch the vulnerability<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>, highlighting the need for manufacturers to prioritize cybersecurity in their designs. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> issued guidelines for automakers to improve vehicle cybersecurity, including recommendations for secure software development practices and incident response protocols.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn6"><p><sup>6</sup>&nbsp;<strong>Automotive Cybersecurity Recalls</strong>: The Jeep Cherokee hack triggered the first-ever automotive cybersecurity recall in 2015.

The agency now mandates that connected vehicles include cybersecurity by design, affecting 99% of new vehicles sold in the US that contain 100+ onboard computers.</p></div></div><p>The Jeep Cherokee hack offers critical lessons for ML system security. Connected ML systems require strict isolation between external interfaces and safety-critical components, as this incident dramatically illustrated. The architectural flaw (allowing external interfaces to reach safety-critical functions) directly threatens modern ML deployments where inference APIs often connect to physical actuators or critical systems.</p>
<p>Modern ML attack vectors exploit these same isolation failures across multiple domains: (1) Autonomous vehicles where compromised infotainment system ML APIs (voice recognition, navigation) gain access to perception models controlling steering and braking; (2) Smart home systems where exploited voice assistant wake-word detection models provide backdoor access to security systems, door locks, and cameras; (3) Industrial IoT where compromised edge ML inference endpoints (predictive maintenance, anomaly detection) manipulate actuator control logic in manufacturing systems; (4) Medical devices where attacked diagnostic ML models influence treatment recommendations and drug delivery systems.</p>
<p>Consider a concrete attack scenario: a smart home voice assistant processes user commands through cloud-based NLP models. An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the voice processing API to inject malicious commands that bypass authentication. Through insufficient network segmentation, the compromised voice system gains access to the home security ML model responsible for facial recognition door unlocking, allowing unauthorized physical access.</p>
<p>Effective defense requires comprehensive isolation architecture: (1) network segmentation to isolate ML inference networks from actuator control networks using firewalls and VPNs; (2) API authentication requiring cryptographic authentication for all ML API calls with rate limiting and anomaly detection; (3) privilege separation to run inference models in sandboxed environments with minimal system permissions; (4) fail-safe defaults that design actuator control logic to revert to safe states (locked doors, stopped motors) when ML systems detect anomalies or lose connectivity; (5) monitoring that implements real-time logging and alerting for suspicious ML API usage patterns.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-weaponized-endpoints-mirai-botnet-931c">Weaponized Endpoints: Mirai Botnet</h3>
<p>While the Jeep Cherokee hack demonstrated targeted exploitation of connected systems, the Mirai botnet revealed how poor security practices could be weaponized at massive scale. In 2016, the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/">Mirai botnet</a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> emerged as one of the most disruptive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> attacks in internet history <span class="citation" data-cites="antonakakis2017understanding">(<a href="#ref-antonakakis2017understanding" role="doc-biblioref">Antonakakis et al. 2017</a>)</span>. The botnet infected thousands of networked devices, including digital cameras, DVRs, and other consumer electronics. These devices, often deployed with factory-default usernames and passwords, were easily compromised by the Mirai malware and enlisted into a large-scale attack network.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn8"><p><sup>8</sup>&nbsp;<strong>Mirai Botnet Scale</strong>: At its peak, Mirai controlled over 600,000 infected IoT devices, generating peak attacks of 1.2 Tbps (1,200 Gbps) against OVH hosting provider, making it one of the first terabit-scale DDoS attacks.

</div></div><p>The Mirai botnet was used to overwhelm major internet infrastructure providers, disrupting access to popular online services across the United States and beyond. The scale of the attack demonstrated how vulnerable consumer and industrial devices can become a platform for widespread disruption when security is not prioritized in their design and deployment.</p>
<p>The Mirai botnet’s lessons apply directly to modern ML deployments. Edge-deployed ML devices with weak authentication become weaponized attack infrastructure at unprecedented scale, precisely as the Mirai botnet demonstrated with traditional IoT devices. Modern ML edge devices (smart cameras running object detection, voice assistants performing wake-word detection, autonomous drones with navigation models, industrial IoT sensors with anomaly detection algorithms) face identical vulnerability patterns but with amplified consequences due to their AI capabilities and access to sensitive data.</p>
<p>The attack escalation with ML devices differs significantly from traditional IoT compromises. Unlike simple IoT devices that provided only computing power for DDoS attacks, compromised ML devices offer sophisticated capabilities: (1) Data exfiltration where smart cameras leak facial recognition databases, voice assistants extract conversation transcripts, and health monitors steal biometric data; (2) Model weaponization where hijacked autonomous drones coordinate swarm attacks and compromised traffic cameras misreport vehicle counts to manipulate traffic systems; (3) AI-powered reconnaissance where compromised edge ML devices use their trained models to identify high-value targets (facial recognition for VIP identification, voice analysis for emotion detection) and coordinate sophisticated multi-stage attacks.</p>
<p>Consider a concrete attack scenario where attackers compromise 50,000 smart security cameras with default passwords, each running ML object detection models. Rather than traditional DDoS attacks, they use the compromised cameras to: (1) extract facial recognition databases from residential and commercial buildings; (2) coordinate physical surveillance of targeted individuals using distributed camera networks; (3) inject false object detection alerts to trigger emergency responses and create chaos; (4) use the cameras’ computing power to train adversarial examples against other security systems.</p>
<p>Comprehensive defense against such weaponization requires zero-trust edge security: (1) Secure manufacturing that eliminates default credentials, implements hardware security modules (HSMs) for device-unique keys, and enables secure boot with cryptographic verification; (2) Encrypted communications that mandate TLS 1.3+ for all ML API communications with certificate pinning and mutual authentication; (3) Behavioral monitoring that deploys anomaly detection systems to identify unusual inference patterns, unexpected network traffic, and suspicious computational loads; (4) Automated response that implements kill switches to disable compromised devices remotely and quarantine them from networks; (5) Update security that enforces cryptographically signed firmware updates with automatic security patching and version rollback capabilities.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-systematic-threat-analysis-risk-assessment-3ef1">Systematic Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment</h2>
<p>The historical incidents demonstrate how fundamental security failures manifest across different computing paradigms. Supply chain vulnerabilities enable persistent compromise, insufficient isolation allows privilege escalation, and weaponized endpoints create attack infrastructure at scale. These patterns directly apply to machine learning deployments: compromised training pipelines and model repositories inherit supply chain risks, external interfaces to safety-critical ML components require strict isolation, and compromised ML edge devices can exfiltrate inference data or participate in coordinated attacks.</p>
<p>These historical incidents reveal universal security patterns that translate directly to ML system vulnerabilities. Supply chain compromise, as demonstrated by Stuxnet, manifests in ML through training data poisoning and backdoored model repositories. Insufficient isolation, exemplified by the Jeep Cherokee hack, appears in ML API access to safety-critical systems and compromised inference endpoints. Weaponized endpoints, illustrated by the Mirai botnet, emerge through hijacked ML edge devices capable of coordinated AI-powered attacks.</p>
<p>The key insight is that traditional cybersecurity patterns amplify in ML systems because models learn from data and make autonomous decisions. While Stuxnet required sophisticated malware to manipulate industrial controllers, ML systems can be compromised through data poisoning that appears statistically normal but embeds hidden behaviors. This characteristic makes ML systems both more vulnerable to subtle attacks and more dangerous when compromised, as they can make decisions affecting physical systems autonomously. Understanding these historical patterns helps recognize how familiar attack vectors manifest in ML contexts, while the unique properties of learning systems (statistical learning, decision autonomy, and data dependency) create new attack surfaces requiring specialized defenses.</p>
<p>Machine learning systems introduce attack vectors that extend beyond traditional computing vulnerabilities. The data-driven nature of learning creates new opportunities for adversaries: training data can be manipulated to embed backdoors, input perturbations can exploit learned decision boundaries, and systematic API queries can extract proprietary model knowledge. These ML-specific threats require specialized defenses that account for the statistical and probabilistic foundations of learning systems, complementing traditional infrastructure hardening.</p>
<section id="sec-security-privacy-threat-prioritization-framework-f2d5" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-threat-prioritization-framework-f2d5">Threat Prioritization Framework</h3>
<p>With the wide range of potential threats facing ML systems, practitioners need a framework to prioritize their defensive efforts effectively. Not all threats are equally likely or impactful, and security resources are always constrained. A simple prioritization matrix based on likelihood and impact helps focus attention where it matters most.</p>
<p>Consider these threat priority categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>High Likelihood / High Impact</strong>: Data poisoning in federated learning systems where training data comes from untrusted sources. These attacks are relatively easy to execute but can severely compromise model behavior.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Likelihood / Medium Impact</strong>: Model extraction attacks against public APIs. These are common and technically simple but may only affect competitive advantage rather than safety or privacy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Low Likelihood / High Impact</strong>: Hardware side-channel attacks on cloud-deployed models. These require sophisticated adversaries and physical access but could expose all model parameters and user data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Medium Likelihood / Medium Impact</strong>: Membership inference attacks against models trained on sensitive data. These require some technical skill but mainly threaten individual privacy rather than system integrity.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This framework guides resource allocation throughout this chapter. We begin with the most common and accessible threats (model theft, data poisoning, and adversarial attacks) before examining more specialized hardware and infrastructure vulnerabilities. Understanding these priority levels helps practitioners implement defenses in a logical sequence that maximizes security benefit per invested effort.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>During Data Collection</strong>: Attackers can inject malicious samples or manipulate labels in training datasets, particularly in federated learning or crowdsourced data scenarios where data sources are less controlled.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>During Training</strong>: This stage faces backdoor insertion attacks, where adversaries embed hidden behaviors that activate only under specific trigger conditions, and label manipulation attacks that systematically corrupt the learning process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>During Deployment</strong>: Model theft attacks target this stage because trained models become accessible through APIs, file downloads, or reverse engineering of mobile applications. This is where intellectual property is most vulnerable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>During Inference</strong>: Adversarial attacks occur at runtime, where attackers craft inputs designed to fool deployed models into making incorrect predictions while appearing normal to human observers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This lifecycle perspective reveals that different threats require different defensive strategies. Data validation protects the collection phase, secure training environments protect the training phase, access controls and API design protect deployment, and input validation protects inference. By understanding which attacks target which lifecycle stages, security teams can implement appropriate defenses at the right architectural layers.</p>

<p>Model theft can target two distinct objectives: extracting exact model properties, such as architecture and parameters, or replicating approximate model behavior to produce similar outputs without direct access to internal representations. Understanding neural network architectures helps recognize which architectural patterns are most vulnerable to extraction attacks. The specific architectural vulnerabilities vary by model type, as discussed in <strong><a href="../dnn_architectures/dnn_architectures.html#sec-dnn-architectures">Chapter 4: DNN Architectures</a></strong>. Both forms of theft undermine the security and value of machine learning systems, as explored in the following subsections.</p>
<p>These two attack paths are illustrated in <a href="#fig-model-theft-types" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3</a>. In exact model theft, the attacker gains access to the model’s internal components, including serialized files, weights, and architecture definitions, and reproduces the model directly. In contrast, approximate model theft relies on observing the model’s input-output behavior, typically through a public API. By repeatedly querying the model and collecting responses, the attacker trains a surrogate that mimics the original model’s functionality. The first approach compromises the model’s internal design and training investment, while the second threatens its predictive value and can facilitate further attacks such as adversarial example transfer or model inversion.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-exact-model-theft-b738">Exact Model Theft</h4>
<p>Exact model property theft refers to attacks aimed at extracting the internal structure and learned parameters of a machine learning model. These attacks often target deployed models that are exposed through APIs, embedded in on-device inference engines, or shared as downloadable model files on collaboration platforms. Exploiting weak access control, insecure model packaging, or unprotected deployment interfaces, attackers can recover proprietary model assets without requiring full control of the underlying infrastructure.</p>
<p>These attacks typically seek three types of information. The first is the model’s learned parameters, such as weights and biases. By extracting these parameters, attackers can replicate the model’s functionality without incurring the cost of training. This replication allows them to benefit from the model’s performance while bypassing the original development effort.</p>
<p>The second target is the model’s fine-tuned hyperparameters, including training configurations such as learning rate, batch size, and regularization settings. These hyperparameters significantly influence model performance, and stealing them allows attackers to reproduce high-quality results with minimal additional experimentation.</p>
<p>Finally, attackers may seek to reconstruct the model’s architecture. This includes the sequence and types of layers, activation functions, and connectivity patterns that define the model’s behavior. Architecture theft may be accomplished through side-channel attacks<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>, reverse engineering, or analysis of observable model behavior.</p>

<p>While some attackers seek to extract a model’s exact internal properties, others focus on replicating its external behavior. Approximate model behavior theft refers to attacks that attempt to recreate a model’s decision-making capabilities without directly accessing its parameters or architecture. Instead, attackers observe the model’s inputs and outputs to build a substitute model that performs similarly on the same tasks.</p>
<p>This type of theft often targets models deployed as services, where the model is exposed through an API or embedded in a user-facing application. By repeatedly querying the model and recording its responses, an attacker can train their own model to mimic the behavior of the original. This process, often called model distillation<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> or knockoff modeling, allows attackers to achieve comparable functionality without access to the original model’s proprietary internals <span class="citation" data-cites="orekondy2019knockoff">(<a href="#ref-orekondy2019knockoff" role="doc-biblioref">Orekondy, Schiele, and Fritz 2019</a>)</span>.</p>

</div></div><p>Attackers may evaluate the success of behavior replication in two ways. The first is by measuring the level of effectiveness of the substitute model. This involves assessing whether the cloned model achieves similar accuracy, precision, recall, or other performance metrics on benchmark tasks. By aligning the substitute’s performance with that of the original, attackers can build a model that is practically indistinguishable in effectiveness, even if its internal structure differs.</p>
<p>The second is by testing prediction consistency. This involves checking whether the substitute model produces the same outputs as the original model when presented with the same inputs. Matching not only correct predictions but also the original model’s mistakes can provide attackers with a high-fidelity reproduction of the target model’s behavior. This poses particular concern in applications such as natural language processing, where attackers might replicate sentiment analysis models to gain competitive insights or bypass proprietary systems.</p>
<p>Approximate behavior theft proves challenging to defend against in open-access deployment settings, such as public APIs or consumer-facing applications. Limiting the rate of queries, detecting automated extraction patterns, and watermarking model outputs are among the techniques that can help mitigate this risk. However, these defenses must be balanced with usability and performance considerations, especially in production environments.</p>
<p>One demonstration of approximate model theft extracts internal components of black-box language models via public APIs. In their paper, <span class="citation" data-cites="carlini2024stealing">Carlini et al. (<a href="#ref-carlini2024stealing" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span>, researchers show how to reconstruct the final embedding projection matrix of several OpenAI models, including <code>ada</code>, <code>babbage</code>, and <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code>, using only public API access. By exploiting the low-rank structure of the output projection layer and making carefully crafted queries, they recover the model’s hidden dimensionality and replicate the weight matrix up to affine transformations.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"></div><p>The attack does not reconstruct the full model, but reveals internal architecture parameters and sets a precedent for future, deeper extractions. This work demonstrated that even partial model theft poses risks to confidentiality and competitive advantage, especially when model behavior can be probed through rich API responses such as logit bias and log-probabilities.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-case-study-tesla-ip-theft-9d78">Case Study: Tesla IP Theft</h4>
<p>In 2018, Tesla filed a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nvd.131251/gov.uscourts.nvd.131251.1.0_1.pdf">lawsuit</a> against the self-driving car startup <a href="https://zoox.com/">Zoox</a>, alleging that former Tesla employees had stolen proprietary data and trade secrets related to Tesla’s autonomous driving technology. According to the lawsuit, several employees transferred over 10 gigabytes of confidential files, including machine learning models and source code, before leaving Tesla to join Zoox.</p>
<p>Among the stolen materials was a key image recognition model used for object detection in Tesla’s self-driving system. By obtaining this model, Zoox could have bypassed years of research and development, giving the company a competitive advantage. Beyond the economic implications, there were concerns that the stolen model could expose Tesla to further security risks, such as model inversion attacks aimed at extracting sensitive data from the model’s training set.</p>
<p>The Zoox employees denied any wrongdoing, and the case was ultimately settled out of court. The incident highlights the real-world risks of model theft, especially in industries where machine learning models represent significant intellectual property. The theft of models not only undermines competitive advantage but also raises broader concerns about privacy, safety, and the potential for downstream exploitation.</p>
<p>This case demonstrates that model theft is not limited to theoretical attacks conducted over APIs or public interfaces. Insider threats, supply chain vulnerabilities, and unauthorized access to development infrastructure pose equally serious risks to machine learning systems deployed in commercial environments.</p>

<p>While model theft targets confidentiality, the second category of threats focuses on training integrity. Training integrity threats stem from the manipulation of data used to train machine learning models. These attacks aim to corrupt the learning process by introducing examples that appear benign but induce harmful or biased behavior in the final model.</p>
<p>Data poisoning attacks are a prominent example, in which adversaries inject carefully crafted data points into the training set to influence model behavior in targeted or systemic ways <span class="citation" data-cites="biggio2012poisoning">(<a href="#ref-biggio2012poisoning" role="doc-biblioref">Biggio, Nelson, and Laskov 2012</a>)</span>.

</div></div></div><p>Data poisoning is a security threat because it involves intentional manipulation of the training data by an adversary, with the goal of embedding vulnerabilities or subverting model behavior. These attacks pose concern in applications where models retrain on data collected from external sources, including user interactions, crowdsourced annotations<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>, and online scraping, since attackers can inject poisoned data without direct access to the training pipeline.</p>
<p>These attacks occur across diverse threat models. From a security perspective, poisoning attacks vary depending on the attacker’s level of access and knowledge. In white-box scenarios, the adversary may have detailed insight into the model architecture or training process, enabling more precise manipulation. In contrast, black-box or limited-access attacks exploit open data submission channels or indirect injection vectors. Poisoning can target different stages of the ML pipeline, ranging from data collection and preprocessing to labeling and storage, making the attack surface both broad and system-dependent. The relative priority of data poisoning threats varies by deployment context as analyzed in <a href="#sec-security-privacy-threat-prioritization-framework-f2d5" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;1.4.1</a>.</p>
<p>Poisoning attacks typically follow a three-stage process. First, the attacker injects malicious data into the training set. These examples are often designed to appear legitimate but introduce subtle distortions that alter the model’s learning process. Second, the model trains on this compromised data, embedding the attacker’s intended behavior. Finally, once the model is deployed, the attacker may exploit the altered behavior to cause mispredictions, bypass safety checks, or degrade overall reliability.</p>
<p>To understand these attack mechanisms precisely, data poisoning can be viewed as a bilevel optimization problem, where the attacker seeks to select poisoning data <span class="math inline">\(D_p\)</span> that maximizes the model’s loss on a validation or target dataset <span class="math inline">\(D_{\text{test}}\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> represent the original training data. The attacker’s objective is to solve: <span class="math display">\[
\max_{D_p} \ \mathcal{L}(f_{D \cup D_p}, D_{\text{test}})
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(f_{D \cup D_p}\)</span> represents the model trained on the combined dataset of original and poisoned data. For targeted attacks, this objective can be refined to focus on specific inputs <span class="math inline">\(x_t\)</span> and target labels <span class="math inline">\(y_t\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[
\max_{D_p} \ \mathcal{L}(f_{D \cup D_p}, x_t, y_t)
\]</span></p>
<p>This formulation captures the adversary’s goal of introducing carefully crafted data points to manipulate the model’s decision boundaries.</p>
<p>For example, consider a traffic sign classification model trained to distinguish between stop signs and speed limit signs. An attacker might inject a small number of stop sign images labeled as speed limit signs into the training data. The attacker’s goal is to subtly shift the model’s decision boundary so that future stop signs are misclassified as speed limit signs. In this case, the poisoning data <span class="math inline">\(D_p\)</span> consists of mislabeled stop sign images, and the attacker’s objective is to maximize the misclassification of legitimate stop signs <span class="math inline">\(x_t\)</span> as speed limit signs <span class="math inline">\(y_t\)</span>, following the targeted attack formulation above. Even if the model performs well on other types of signs, the poisoned training process creates a predictable and exploitable vulnerability.</p>
<p>Data poisoning attacks can be classified based on their objectives and scope of impact. Availability attacks degrade overall model performance by introducing noise or label flips that reduce accuracy across tasks. Targeted attacks manipulate a specific input or class, leaving general performance intact but causing consistent misclassification in select cases. Backdoor attacks<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> embed hidden triggers, which are often imperceptible patterns, that elicit malicious behavior only when the trigger is present. Subpopulation attacks degrade performance on a specific group defined by shared features, making them particularly dangerous in fairness-sensitive applications.</p>

<p>Mitigating data poisoning threats requires end-to-end security of the data pipeline, encompassing collection, storage, labeling, and training. Preventative measures include input validation checks, integrity verification of training datasets, and anomaly detection to flag suspicious patterns. In parallel, robust training algorithms can limit the influence of mislabeled or manipulated data by down-weighting or filtering out anomalous instances. While no single technique guarantees immunity, combining proactive data governance, automated monitoring, and robust learning practices is important for maintaining model integrity in real-world deployments.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-adversarial-attacks-9f84">Adversarial Attacks</h3>
<p>Moving from training-time to inference-time threats, the third category targets model robustness during deployment. Inference robustness threats occur when attackers manipulate inputs at test time to induce incorrect predictions. Unlike data poisoning, which compromises the training process, these attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the model’s decision surface during inference.</p>
<p>A central class of such threats is adversarial attacks, where carefully constructed inputs are designed to cause incorrect predictions while remaining nearly indistinguishable from legitimate data. As detailed in <strong><a href="../robust_ai/robust_ai.html#sec-robust-ai">Chapter 16: Robust AI</a></strong>, these attacks highlight vulnerabilities in ML models’ sensitivity to small, targeted perturbations that can drastically alter output confidence or classification results.</p>
<p>These attacks create significant real-world risks in domains such as autonomous driving, biometric authentication, and content moderation. The effectiveness can be striking: research demonstrates that adversarial examples can achieve 99%+ attack success rates against state-of-the-art image classifiers while modifying less than 0.01% of pixel values, changes virtually imperceptible to humans <span class="citation" data-cites="szegedy2014intriguing goodfellow2015explaining">(<a href="#ref-szegedy2014intriguing" role="doc-biblioref">Szegedy et al. 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-goodfellow2015explaining" role="doc-biblioref">Goodfellow, Shlens, and Szegedy 2014</a>)</span>. In physical-world attacks, printed adversarial patches as small as 2% of an image can cause autonomous vehicles to misclassify stop signs as speed limit signs with 80%+ success rates under varying lighting conditions <span class="citation" data-cites="eykholt2018robust">(<a href="#ref-eykholt2018robust" role="doc-biblioref">Eykholt et al. 2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"></div><p>Unlike data poisoning, which corrupts the model during training, adversarial attacks manipulate the model’s behavior at test time, often without requiring any access to the training data or model internals. The attack surface thus shifts from upstream data pipelines to real-time interaction, demanding robust defense mechanisms capable of detecting or mitigating malicious inputs at the point of inference.</p>
<p>The mathematical foundations of adversarial example generation and comprehensive taxonomies of attack algorithms, including gradient-based, optimization-based, and transfer-based techniques, are covered in detail in <strong><a href="../robust_ai/robust_ai.html#sec-robust-ai">Chapter 16: Robust AI</a></strong>, which explores robust approaches to building adversarially resistant systems.</p>
<p>Adversarial attacks vary based on the attacker’s level of access to the model. In white-box attacks, the adversary has full knowledge of the model’s architecture, parameters, and training data, allowing them to craft highly effective adversarial examples. In black-box attacks, the adversary has no internal knowledge and must rely on querying the model and observing its outputs. Grey-box attacks fall between these extremes, with the adversary possessing partial information, such as access to the model architecture but not its parameters.</p>
<p>These attacker models can be summarized along a spectrum of knowledge levels. <a href="#tbl-adversary-knowledge-spectrum" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;3</a> highlights the differences in model access, data access, typical attack strategies, and common deployment scenarios. Such distinctions help characterize the practical challenges of securing ML systems across different deployment environments.</p>

<p>This demonstration showed how simple adversarial stickers could trick ML systems into misreading important road signs.

<p>The appropriate defense for a given threat depends on its type, attack vector, and where it occurs in the ML lifecycle. <a href="#fig-threat-mitigation-flow" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5</a> provides a simplified decision flow that connects common threat categories, such as model theft, data poisoning, and adversarial examples, to corresponding defensive strategies. While real-world deployments may require more nuanced combinations of defenses as discussed in our layered defense framework, this flowchart serves as a conceptual guide for aligning threat models with practical mitigation techniques.</p>
<p>While ML models themselves present important attack surfaces, they ultimately run on hardware that can introduce vulnerabilities beyond the model’s control. The transition from software-based threats to hardware-based vulnerabilities represents a significant shift in the security landscape. Where software attacks target code logic and data flows, hardware attacks exploit the physical properties of the computing substrate itself.</p>
<p>The specialized computing infrastructure that powers machine learning workloads creates a layered attack surface that extends far beyond traditional software vulnerabilities. This includes the processors that execute instructions, the memory systems that store data, and the interconnects that move information between components. Understanding these hardware-level risks is essential because they can bypass conventional software security mechanisms and remain difficult to detect. These risks are addressed through the hardware-based security mechanisms detailed in <a href="#sec-security-privacy-hardware-security-foundations-f5e8" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;1.8.7</a>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-hardwarelevel-security-vulnerabilities-1ab4">Hardware-Level Security Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>As machine learning systems move from research prototypes to large-scale, real-world deployments, their security depends on the hardware platforms they run on. Whether deployed in data centers, on edge devices, or in embedded systems, machine learning applications rely on a layered stack of processors, accelerators, memory, and communication interfaces. These hardware components, while essential for enabling efficient computation, introduce unique security risks that go beyond traditional software-based vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Unlike general-purpose software systems, machine learning workflows often process high-value models and sensitive data in performance-constrained environments. This makes them attractive targets not only for software attacks but also for hardware-level exploitation. Vulnerabilities in hardware can expose models to theft, leak user data, disrupt system reliability, or allow adversaries to manipulate inference results. Because hardware operates below the software stack, such attacks can bypass conventional security mechanisms and remain difficult to detect.</p>
<p>Understanding hardware security threats requires considering how computing substrates implement machine learning operations. At the hardware level, CPU components like arithmetic logic units, registers, and caches execute the instructions that drive model inference and training. Memory hierarchies determine how quickly models can access parameters and intermediate results. The hardware-software interface, mediated by firmware and bootloaders, establishes the initial trust foundation for system operation. The physical properties of computation—including power consumption, timing characteristics, and electromagnetic emissions—create observable signals that attackers can exploit to extract sensitive information.</p>
<p>Hardware threats arise from multiple sources that span the entire system lifecycle. Design flaws in processor architectures, exemplified by vulnerabilities like Meltdown and Spectre, can compromise security guarantees. Physical tampering enables direct manipulation of components and data flows. Side-channel attacks exploit unintended information leakage through power traces, timing variations, and electromagnetic radiation. Supply chain compromises introduce malicious components or modifications during manufacturing and distribution. Together, these threats form a critical attack surface that must be addressed to build trustworthy machine learning systems. For readers focusing on practical deployment, the key lessons center on supply chain verification, physical access controls, and hardware trust anchors, while the defensive strategies in <a href="#sec-security-privacy-comprehensive-defense-architectures-48ab" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;1.8</a> provide actionable guidance regardless of deep architectural expertise.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-hardware-bugs-9efc">Hardware Bugs</h3>
<p>The first category of hardware threats stems from design vulnerabilities. Hardware is not immune to the pervasive issue of design flaws or bugs. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to access, manipulate, or extract sensitive data, breaching the confidentiality and integrity that users and services depend on. One of the most notable examples came with the discovery of <a href="https://meltdownattack.com/">Meltdown and Spectre</a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>—two vulnerabilities in modern processors that allow malicious programs to bypass memory isolation and read the data of other applications and the operating system <span class="citation" data-cites="Lipp2018meltdown Kocher2018spectre">(<a href="#ref-Lipp2018meltdown" role="doc-biblioref">Kocher et al. 2019a</a>, <a href="#ref-Kocher2018spectre" role="doc-biblioref">2019b</a>)</span>.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn24"><p><sup>24</sup>&nbsp;<strong>Meltdown/Spectre Impact</strong>: Disclosed in January 2018, these vulnerabilities affected virtually every processor made since 1995 (billions of devices).

</div><div id="fn25"><p><sup>25</sup>&nbsp;<strong>Speculative Execution</strong>: Introduced in the Intel Pentium Pro (1995), this technique executes instructions before confirming they’re needed, improving performance by 10-25%. However, it creates a 20+ year attack window where speculated operations leak data through cache timing, affecting ML accelerators that rely on similar optimizations.</p></div></div><p>These attacks exploit speculative execution<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>, a performance optimization in CPUs that executes instructions out of order before safety checks are complete. While improving computational speed, this optimization inadvertently exposes sensitive data through microarchitectural side channels, such as CPU caches. The technical sophistication of these attacks highlights the difficulty of eliminating vulnerabilities even with extensive hardware validation.</p>
<p>Further research has revealed that these were not isolated incidents. Variants such as Foreshadow, ZombieLoad, and RIDL target different microarchitectural elements, ranging from secure enclaves to CPU internal buffers, demonstrating that speculative execution flaws are a systemic hardware risk. This systemic nature means that while these attacks were first demonstrated on general-purpose CPUs, their implications extend to machine learning accelerators and specialized hardware. ML systems often rely on heterogeneous compute platforms that combine CPUs with GPUs, TPUs, FPGAs, or custom accelerators. These components process sensitive data such as personal information, medical records, or proprietary models. Vulnerabilities in any part of this stack could expose such data to attackers.</p>
<p>For example, an edge device like a smart camera running a face recognition model on an accelerator could be vulnerable if the hardware lacks proper cache isolation. An attacker might exploit this weakness to extract intermediate computations, model parameters, or user data. Similar risks exist in cloud inference services, where hardware multi-tenancy increases the chances of cross-tenant data leakage.</p>
<p>Such vulnerabilities pose concern in privacy-sensitive domains like healthcare, where ML systems routinely handle patient data. A breach could violate privacy regulations such as the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/php/resources/health-insurance-portability-and-accountability-act-of-1996-hipaa.html">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>, leading to significant legal and ethical consequences.

It also requires architectural safeguards to prevent data leakage through the hardware itself. As new vulnerabilities continue to emerge across processors, accelerators, and memory systems, addressing these risks requires continuous mitigation efforts, often involving performance trade-offs, especially in compute- and memory-intensive ML workloads. Proactive solutions, such as confidential computing and trusted execution environments (TEEs), offer promising architectural defenses. However, achieving robust hardware security requires attention at every stage of the system lifecycle, from design to deployment.</p>

<section id="sec-security-privacy-physical-attacks-095a" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-physical-attacks-095a">Physical Attacks</h3>
<p>Beyond design flaws, the second category involves direct physical manipulation. Physical tampering refers to the direct, unauthorized manipulation of computing hardware to undermine the integrity of machine learning systems. This type of attack is particularly concerning because it bypasses traditional software security defenses, directly targeting the physical components on which machine learning depends. ML systems are especially vulnerable to such attacks because they rely on hardware sensors, accelerators, and storage to process large volumes of data and produce reliable outcomes in real-world environments.</p>
<p>While software security measures, including encryption, authentication, and access control, protect ML systems against remote attacks, they offer little defense against adversaries with physical access to devices. Physical tampering can range from simple actions, like inserting a malicious USB device into an edge server, to highly sophisticated manipulations such as embedding hardware trojans during chip manufacturing. These threats are particularly relevant for machine learning systems deployed at the edge or in physically exposed environments, where attackers may have opportunities to interfere with the hardware directly.</p>
<p>To understand how such attacks affect ML systems in practice, consider the example of an ML-powered drone used for environmental mapping or infrastructure inspection. The drone’s navigation depends on machine learning models that process data from GPS, cameras, and inertial measurement units. If an attacker gains physical access to the drone, they could replace or modify its navigation module, embedding a hidden backdoor that alters flight behavior or reroutes data collection. Such manipulation not only compromises the system’s reliability but also opens the door to misuse, such as surveillance or smuggling operations.</p>
<p>These threats extend across application domains. Physical attacks are not limited to mobility systems. Biometric access control systems, which rely on ML models to process face or fingerprint data, are also vulnerable. These systems typically use embedded hardware to capture and process biometric inputs. An attacker could physically replace a biometric sensor with a modified component designed to capture and transmit personal identification data to an unauthorized receiver. This creates multiple vulnerabilities including unauthorized data access and enabling future impersonation attacks.</p>
<p>In addition to tampering with external sensors, attackers may target internal hardware subsystems. For example, the sensors used in autonomous vehicles, including cameras, LiDAR, and radar, are important for ML models that interpret the surrounding environment. A malicious actor could physically misalign or obstruct these sensors, degrading the model’s perception capabilities and creating safety hazards.</p>
<p>Hardware trojans pose another serious risk. Malicious modifications introduced during chip fabrication or assembly can embed dormant circuits in ML accelerators or inference chips. These trojans may remain inactive under normal conditions but trigger malicious behavior when specific inputs are processed or system states are reached. Such hidden vulnerabilities can disrupt computations, leak model outputs, or degrade system performance in ways that are extremely difficult to diagnose post-deployment.</p>
<p>Memory subsystems are also attractive targets. Attackers with physical access to edge devices or embedded ML accelerators could manipulate memory chips to extract encrypted model parameters or training data. Fault injection techniques, including voltage manipulation and electromagnetic interference, can further degrade system reliability by corrupting model weights or forcing incorrect computations during inference.</p>
<p>Physical access threats extend to data center and cloud environments as well. Attackers with sufficient access could install hardware implants, such as keyloggers or data interceptors, to capture administrative credentials or monitor data streams. Such implants can provide persistent backdoor access, enabling long-term surveillance or data exfiltration from ML training and inference pipelines.</p>
<p>In summary, physical attacks on machine learning systems threaten both security and reliability across a wide range of deployment environments. Addressing these risks requires a combination of hardware-level protections, tamper detection mechanisms, and supply chain integrity checks. Without these safeguards, even the most secure software defenses may be undermined by vulnerabilities introduced through direct physical manipulation.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-fault-injection-attacks-8c52">Fault Injection Attacks</h3>
<p>Building on physical tampering techniques, fault injection represents a more sophisticated approach to hardware exploitation. Fault injection is a powerful class of physical attacks that deliberately disrupts hardware operations to induce errors in computation. These induced faults can compromise the integrity of machine learning models by causing them to produce incorrect outputs, degrade reliability, or leak sensitive information. For ML systems, such faults not only disrupt inference but also expose models to deeper exploitation, including reverse engineering and bypass of security protocols <span class="citation" data-cites="joye2012fault">(<a href="#ref-joye2012fault" role="doc-biblioref">Joye and Tunstall 2012</a>)</span>.</p>

These disturbances can cause effects such as bit flips, skipped instructions, or corrupted memory states, which adversaries can exploit to alter ML model behavior or extract sensitive information.</p>
<p>For machine learning systems, these attacks pose several concrete risks. Fault injection can degrade model accuracy, force incorrect classifications, trigger denial of service, or even leak internal model parameters. For example, attackers could inject faults into an embedded ML model running on a microcontroller, forcing it to misclassify inputs in safety-important applications such as autonomous navigation or medical diagnostics. More sophisticated attackers may target memory or control logic to steal intellectual property, such as proprietary model weights or architecture details.</p>
<p>The practical viability of these attacks has been demonstrated through controlled experiments.

<p>This manipulation is illustrated in <a href="#fig-injection" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;7</a>, which shows a segment of assembly code implementing the ReLU activation function. Normally, the code compares the most significant bit (MSB) of the accumulator to zero and uses a brge (branch if greater or equal) instruction to skip the assignment if the value is non-positive. However, the fault injection suppresses the branch, causing the processor to always execute the “else” block. As a result, the neuron’s output is forcibly zeroed out, regardless of the input value.</p>

<p>Fault injection attacks can also be combined with side-channel analysis, where attackers first observe power or timing characteristics to infer model structure or data flow. This reconnaissance allows them to target specific layers or operations, such as activation functions or final decision layers, maximizing the impact of the injected faults.</p>
<p>Embedded and edge ML systems are particularly vulnerable because they often lack physical hardening and operate under resource constraints that limit runtime defenses. Without tamper-resistant packaging or secure hardware enclaves, attackers may gain direct access to system buses and memory, enabling precise fault manipulation. Many embedded ML models are designed to be lightweight, leaving them with little redundancy or error correction to recover from induced faults.</p>
<p>Mitigating fault injection requires multiple complementary protections. Physical protections, such as tamper-proof enclosures and design obfuscation, help limit physical access. Anomaly detection techniques can monitor sensor inputs or model outputs for signs of fault-induced inconsistencies <span class="citation" data-cites="hsiao2023mavfi">(<a href="#ref-hsiao2023mavfi" role="doc-biblioref">Hsiao et al. 2023</a>)</span>. Error-correcting memories and secure firmware can reduce the likelihood of silent corruption. Techniques such as model watermarking may provide traceability if stolen models are later deployed by an adversary.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-sidechannel-attacks-cdfd">Side-Channel Attacks</h3>
<p>Moving from direct fault injection to indirect information leakage, side-channel attacks constitute a class of security breaches that exploit information inadvertently revealed through the physical implementation of computing systems. In contrast to direct attacks that target software or network vulnerabilities, these attacks use the system’s hardware characteristics, including power consumption, electromagnetic emissions, or timing behavior, to extract sensitive information.</p>
<p>The core premise of a side-channel attack is that a device’s operation can leak information through observable physical signals. Such leaks may originate from the electrical power the device consumes <span class="citation" data-cites="kocher1999differential">(<a href="#ref-kocher1999differential" role="doc-biblioref">Kocher, Jaffe, and Jun 1999</a>)</span>, the electromagnetic fields it emits <span class="citation" data-cites="gandolfi2001electromagnetic">(<a href="#ref-gandolfi2001electromagnetic" role="doc-biblioref">Gandolfi, Mourtel, and Olivier 2001</a>)</span>, the time required to complete computations, or even the acoustic noise it produces. By carefully measuring and analyzing these signals, attackers can infer internal system states or recover secret data.</p>

</div></div><p>Although these techniques are commonly discussed in cryptography, they are equally relevant to machine learning systems. ML models deployed on hardware accelerators, embedded devices, or edge systems often process sensitive data. Even when these models are protected by secure algorithms or encryption, their physical execution may leak side-channel signals that can be exploited by adversaries.</p>
<p>One of the most widely studied examples involves Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> implementations. While AES is mathematically secure, the physical process of computing its encryption functions leaks measurable signals.</p>

Despite being mathematically secure with 2^128 possible keys for AES-128, physical implementations remain vulnerable to side-channel attacks that can extract keys in minutes. Techniques such as Differential Power Analysis (DPA), Differential Electromagnetic Analysis (DEMA), and Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) exploit these physical signals to recover secret keys.</p></div></div><p>A useful example of this attack technique can be seen in a power analysis of a password authentication process. Consider a device that verifies a 5-byte password—in this case, <code>0x61, 0x52, 0x77, 0x6A, 0x73</code>. During authentication, the device receives each byte sequentially over a serial interface, and its power consumption pattern reveals how the system responds as it processes these inputs.</p>
<p><a href="#fig-encryption" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;8</a> shows the device’s behavior when the correct password is entered. The red waveform captures the serial data stream, marking each byte as it is received. The blue curve records the device’s power consumption over time. When the full, correct password is supplied, the power profile remains stable and consistent across all five bytes, providing a clear baseline for comparison with failed attempts.</p>

<p>When an incorrect password is entered, the power analysis chart changes as shown in <a href="#fig-encryption2" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;9</a>. In this case, the first three bytes (<code>0x61, 0x52, 0x77</code>) are correct, so the power patterns closely match the correct password up to that point.

<p>These examples demonstrate how attackers can exploit observable power consumption differences to reduce the search space and eventually recover secret data through brute-force analysis. By systematically measuring power consumption patterns and correlating them with different inputs, attackers can extract sensitive information that should remain hidden.</p>
<p>The scope of these vulnerabilities extends beyond cryptographic applications. Machine learning applications face similar risks. For example, an ML-based speech recognition system processing voice commands on a local device could leak timing or power signals that reveal which commands are being processed. Even subtle acoustic or electromagnetic emissions may expose operational patterns that an adversary could exploit to infer user behavior.</p>
<p>Historically, side-channel attacks have been used to bypass even the most secure cryptographic systems. In the 1960s, British intelligence agency MI5 famously exploited acoustic emissions from a cipher machine in the Egyptian Embassy <span class="citation" data-cites="Burnet1989Spycatcher">(<a href="#ref-Burnet1989Spycatcher" role="doc-biblioref">Burnet and Thomas 1989</a>)</span>. By capturing the mechanical clicks of the machine’s rotors, MI5 analysts were able to dramatically reduce the complexity of breaking encrypted messages. This early example illustrates that side-channel vulnerabilities are not confined to the digital age but are rooted in the physical nature of computation.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-leaky-interfaces-9206">Leaky Interfaces</h3>
<p>While side-channel attacks exploit unintended physical signals, leaky interfaces represent a different category of vulnerability involving exposed communication channels. Interfaces in computing systems are important for enabling communication, diagnostics, and updates. However, these same interfaces can become significant security vulnerabilities when they unintentionally expose sensitive information or accept unverified inputs. Such leaky interfaces often go unnoticed during system design, yet they provide attackers with powerful entry points to extract data, manipulate functionality, or introduce malicious code.</p>
<p>A leaky interface is any access point that reveals more information than intended, often because of weak authentication, lack of encryption, or inadequate isolation. These issues have been widely demonstrated across consumer, medical, and industrial systems.</p>
<p>For example, many WiFi-enabled baby monitors have been found to expose unsecured remote access ports<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>, allowing attackers to intercept live audio and video feeds from inside private homes. Similarly, researchers have identified wireless vulnerabilities in pacemakers<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> that could allow attackers to manipulate cardiac functions if exploited, raising life-threatening safety concerns.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn29"><p><sup>29</sup>&nbsp;<strong>IoT Device Vulnerabilities</strong>: Studies reveal 70-80% of IoT devices contain serious security flaws, with baby monitors among the worst offenders. Security firm Rapid7 found that popular baby monitor brands exposed unencrypted video streams, affecting millions of households globally.</p></div><div id="fn30"><p><sup>30</sup>&nbsp;<strong>Medical Device Security</strong>: FDA reports show 53% of medical devices contain known vulnerabilities, with pacemakers and insulin pumps most at risk. The average medical device contains 6.2 vulnerabilities, some dating back over a decade, affecting 2.4 billion medical devices worldwide.</p></div><div id="fn31"><p><sup>31</sup>&nbsp;<strong>Debug Port Vulnerabilities</strong>: Hardware debug interfaces like JTAG (1990) and SWD (2006) are essential for development but often left accessible in production. Security researchers estimate that 60-70% of embedded devices ship with unsecured debug ports, creating backdoors for attackers.</p></div></div><p>A notable case involving smart lightbulbs demonstrated that accessible debug ports<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> left on production devices leaked unencrypted WiFi credentials. This security oversight provided attackers with a pathway to infiltrate home networks without needing to bypass standard security mechanisms.</p>
<p>These examples reveal vulnerability patterns that directly apply to machine learning deployments. While these examples do not target machine learning systems directly, they illustrate architectural patterns that are highly relevant to ML-allowd devices. Consider a smart home security system that uses machine learning to detect user routines and automate responses. Such a system may include a maintenance or debug interface for software updates. If this interface lacks proper authentication or transmits data unencrypted, attackers on the same network could gain unauthorized access. This intrusion could expose user behavior patterns, compromise model integrity, or disable security features altogether.</p>
<p>Leaky interfaces in ML systems can also expose training data, model parameters, or intermediate outputs. Such exposure can allow attackers to craft adversarial examples, steal proprietary models, or reverse-engineer system behavior. Worse still, these interfaces may allow attackers to tamper with firmware, introducing malicious code that disables devices or recruits them into botnets.</p>
<p>Mitigating these risks requires coordinated protections across technical and organizational domains. Technical safeguards such as strong authentication, encrypted communications, and runtime anomaly detection are important. Organizational practices such as interface inventories, access control policies, and ongoing audits are equally important. Adopting a zero-trust architecture, where no interface is trusted by default, further reduces exposure by limiting access to only what is strictly necessary.</p>
<p>For designers of ML-powered systems, securing interfaces must be a first-class concern alongside algorithmic and data-centric design. Whether the system operates in the cloud, on the edge, or in embedded environments, failure to secure these access points risks undermining the entire system’s trustworthiness.</p>

<section id="sec-security-privacy-counterfeit-hardware-36fd" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-counterfeit-hardware-36fd">Counterfeit Hardware</h3>
<p>Beyond vulnerabilities in legitimate hardware, another significant threat emerges from the supply chain itself. Machine learning systems depend on the reliability and security of the hardware on which they run. Yet, in today’s globalized hardware ecosystem, the risk of counterfeit or cloned hardware has emerged as a serious threat to system integrity. Counterfeit components refer to unauthorized reproductions of genuine parts, designed to closely imitate their appearance and functionality. These components can enter machine learning systems through complex procurement and manufacturing processes that span multiple vendors and regions.</p>
<p>A single lapse in component sourcing can introduce counterfeit hardware into important systems. For example, a facial recognition system deployed for secure facility access might unknowingly rely on counterfeit processors. These unauthorized components could fail to process biometric data correctly or introduce hidden vulnerabilities that allow attackers to bypass authentication controls.</p>
<p>The risks posed by counterfeit hardware are multifaceted. From a reliability perspective, such components often degrade faster, perform unpredictably, or fail under load due to substandard manufacturing. From a security perspective, counterfeit hardware may include hidden backdoors or malicious circuitry, providing attackers with undetectable pathways to compromise machine learning systems. A cloned network router installed in a data center, for instance, could silently intercept model predictions or user data, creating systemic vulnerabilities across the entire infrastructure.</p>
<p>Legal and regulatory risks further compound the problem. Organizations that unknowingly integrate counterfeit components into their ML systems may face serious legal consequences, including penalties for violating safety, privacy, or cybersecurity regulations<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>. This is particularly concerning in sectors such as healthcare and finance, where compliance with industry standards is non-negotiable. Healthcare organizations must demonstrate HIPAA compliance throughout their technology stack, while organizations handling EU citizens’ data must meet GDPR’s requirements for technical and organizational measures, including supply chain integrity.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn32"><p><sup>32</sup>&nbsp;<strong>Cybersecurity Regulations</strong>: Global cybersecurity compliance costs exceed $150 billion annually, with frameworks like SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, and sector-specific rules governing ML systems. Financial services face additional requirements under regulations like SOX, while healthcare must comply with HIPAA, creating complex multi-regulatory environments.</p></div></div><p>Economic pressures often incentivize sourcing from lower-cost suppliers without rigorous verification, increasing the likelihood of counterfeit parts entering production systems. Detection is especially challenging, as counterfeit components are designed to mimic legitimate ones. Identifying them may require specialized equipment or forensic analysis, making prevention far more practical than remediation.</p>
<p>The stakes are particularly high in machine learning applications that require high reliability and low latency, such as real-time decision-making in autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, or important healthcare diagnostics. Hardware failure in these contexts can lead not only to system downtime but also to significant safety risks. Consequently, as machine learning continues to expand into safety-important and high-value applications, counterfeit hardware presents a growing risk that must be recognized and addressed. Organizations must treat hardware trustworthiness as a core design requirement, on par with algorithmic accuracy and data security, to ensure that ML systems can operate reliably and securely in the real world.</p>

<section id="sec-security-privacy-supply-chain-risks-c99c" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-supply-chain-risks-c99c">Supply Chain Risks</h3>
<p>Counterfeit hardware exemplifies a broader systemic challenge. While counterfeit hardware presents a serious challenge, it is only one part of the larger problem of securing the global hardware supply chain. Machine learning systems are built from components that pass through complex supply networks involving design, fabrication, assembly, distribution, and integration. Each of these stages presents opportunities for tampering, substitution, or counterfeiting—often without the knowledge of those deploying the final system.</p>
<p>Malicious actors can exploit these vulnerabilities in various ways. A contracted manufacturer might unknowingly receive recycled electronic waste that has been relabeled as new components. A distributor might deliberately mix cloned parts into otherwise legitimate shipments. Insiders at manufacturing facilities might embed hardware Trojans that are nearly impossible to detect once the system is deployed. Advanced counterfeits can be particularly deceptive, with refurbished or repackaged components designed to pass visual inspection while concealing inferior or malicious internals.</p>
<p>Identifying such compromises typically requires sophisticated analysis, including micrography, X-ray screening, and functional testing. However, these methods are costly and impractical for large-scale procurement. As a result, many organizations deploy systems without fully verifying the authenticity and security of every component.</p>
<p>The risks extend beyond individual devices. Machine learning systems often rely on heterogeneous hardware platforms, integrating CPUs, GPUs, memory, and specialized accelerators sourced from a global supply base. Any compromise in one part of this chain can undermine the security of the entire system. These risks are further amplified when systems operate in shared or multi-tenant environments, such as cloud data centers or federated edge networks, where hardware-level isolation is important to preventing cross-tenant attacks.</p>
<p>The 2018 Bloomberg Businessweek report alleging that Chinese state actors inserted spy chips into Supermicro server motherboards brought these risks to mainstream attention. While the claims remain disputed, the story underscored the industry’s limited visibility into its own hardware supply chains. Companies often rely on complex, opaque manufacturing and distribution networks, leaving them vulnerable to hidden compromises. Over-reliance on single manufacturers or regions, including the semiconductor industry’s reliance on TSMC, further concentrates this risk. This recognition has driven policy responses like the U.S. <a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/08/09/fact-sheet-two-years-after-the-chips-and-science-act-biden-%E2%81%A0harris-administration-celebrates-historic-achievements-in-bringing-semiconductor-supply-chains-home-creating-jobs-supporting-inn/">CHIPS and Science Act</a>, which aims to bring semiconductor production onshore and strengthen supply chain resilience.</p>
<p>Securing machine learning systems requires moving beyond trust-by-default models toward zero-trust supply chain practices. This includes screening suppliers, validating component provenance, implementing tamper-evident protections, and continuously monitoring system behavior for signs of compromise. Building fault-tolerant architectures that detect and contain failures provides an additional layer of defense.</p>
<p>Ultimately, supply chain risks must be treated as a first-class concern in ML system design. Trust in the computational models and data pipelines that power machine learning depends corely on the trustworthiness of the hardware on which they run. Without securing the hardware foundation, even the most sophisticated models remain vulnerable to compromise.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-case-study-supermicro-controversy-72b7">Case Study: Supermicro Controversy</h3>
<p>The abstract nature of supply chain risks became concrete in a high-profile controversy that captured industry attention. In 2018, Bloomberg Businessweek published a widely discussed report alleging that Chinese state-sponsored actors had secretly implanted tiny surveillance chips on server motherboards manufactured by Supermicro <span class="citation" data-cites="TheBigHa77">(<a href="#ref-TheBigHa77" role="doc-biblioref">Robertson and Riley 2018</a>)</span>. These compromised servers were reportedly deployed by more than 30 major companies, including Apple and Amazon. The chips, described as no larger than a grain of rice, were said to provide attackers with backdoor access to sensitive data and systems.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="ref-TheBigHa77" class="csl-entry" role="listitem">
Robertson, J., and M. Riley. 2018. <span>“The Big Hack: How China Used a Tiny Chip to Infiltrate u.s. Companies - Bloomberg.”</span><a href="

  ">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies </a>.
</div></div><p>The allegations sparked immediate concern across the technology industry, raising questions about the security of global supply chains and the potential for state-level hardware manipulation. However, the companies named in the report publicly denied the claims. Apple, Amazon, and Supermicro stated that they had found no evidence of the alleged implants after conducting thorough internal investigations. Industry experts and government agencies also expressed skepticism, noting the lack of verifiable technical evidence presented in the report.</p>
<p>Despite these denials, the story had a lasting impact on how organizations and policymakers view hardware supply chain security. Whether or not the specific claims were accurate, the report highlighted the real and growing concern that hardware supply chains are difficult to fully audit and secure. It underscored how geopolitical tensions, manufacturing outsourcing, and the complexity of modern hardware ecosystems make it increasingly challenging to guarantee the integrity of hardware components.</p>
<p>The Supermicro case illustrates a broader truth: once a product enters a complex global supply chain, it becomes difficult to ensure that every component is free from tampering or unauthorized modification. This risk is particularly acute for machine learning systems, which depend on a wide range of hardware accelerators, memory modules, and processing units sourced from multiple vendors across the globe.</p>
<p>In response to these risks, both industry and government stakeholders have begun to invest in supply chain security initiatives. The U.S. government’s CHIPS and Science Act is one such effort, aiming to bring semiconductor manufacturing back onshore to improve transparency and reduce dependency on foreign suppliers. While these efforts are valuable, they do not fully eliminate supply chain risks. They must be complemented by technical safeguards, such as component validation, runtime monitoring, and fault-tolerant system design.</p>
<p>The Supermicro controversy serves as a cautionary tale for the machine learning community. It demonstrates that hardware security cannot be taken for granted, even when working with reputable suppliers. Ensuring the integrity of ML systems requires rigorous attention to the entire hardware lifecycle—from design and fabrication to deployment and maintenance. This case reinforces the need for organizations to adopt comprehensive supply chain security practices as a foundational element of trustworthy ML system design.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-ml-systems-become-attack-tools-2f34">When ML Systems Become Attack Tools</h2>
<p>The threats examined thus far—model theft, data poisoning, adversarial attacks, hardware vulnerabilities—represent attacks targeting machine learning systems. However, a complete threat model must also account for the inverse: machine learning as an attack amplifier. The same capabilities that make ML powerful for beneficial applications also enhance adversarial operations, transforming machine learning from passive target to active weapon.</p>
<p>While machine learning systems are often treated as assets to protect, they may also serve as tools for launching attacks. In adversarial settings, the same models used to enhance productivity, automate perception, or assist decision-making can be repurposed to execute or amplify offensive operations. This dual-use characteristic of machine learning, its capacity to secure systems as well as to subvert them, marks a core shift in how ML must be considered within system-level threat models.</p>
<p>An offensive use of machine learning refers to any scenario in which a machine learning model is employed to facilitate the compromise of another system. In such cases, the model itself is not the object under attack, but the mechanism through which an adversary advances their objectives. These applications may involve reconnaissance, inference, subversion, impersonation, or the automation of exploit strategies that would otherwise require manual execution.</p>
<p>Importantly, such offensive applications are not speculative. Attackers are already integrating machine learning into their toolchains across a wide range of activities, from spam filtering evasion to model-driven malware generation. What distinguishes these scenarios is the deliberate use of learning-based systems to extract, manipulate, or generate information in ways that undermine the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of targeted components.</p>
<p>To clarify the diversity and structure of these applications, <a href="#tbl-offensive-ml-use-cases" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;6</a> summarizes several representative use cases. For each, the table identifies the type of machine learning model typically employed, the underlying system vulnerability it exploits, and the primary advantage conferred by the use of machine learning.</p>

<p>These documented cases illustrate how machine learning models can serve as amplifiers of adversarial capability. For example, language models allow more convincing and adaptable phishing attacks, while clustering and classification algorithms facilitate reconnaissance by learning system-level behavioral patterns. The generative AI capabilities of large language models particularly amplify these offensive applications. Similarly, adversarial example generators and inference models systematically uncover weaknesses in decision boundaries or data privacy protections, often requiring only limited external access to deployed systems. In hardware contexts, as discussed in the next section, deep neural networks trained on side-channel data can automate the extraction of cryptographic secrets from physical measurements—transforming an expert-driven process into a learnable pattern recognition task. The deep learning foundations from <strong><a href="../dl_primer/dl_primer.html#sec-dl-primer">Chapter 3: Deep Learning Primer</a></strong>—convolutional neural networks for spatial pattern recognition, recurrent architectures for temporal dependencies, and gradient-based optimization—enable attackers to apply these techniques across various hardware platforms discussed in <strong><a href="../hw_acceleration/hw_acceleration.html#sec-ai-acceleration">Chapter 11: AI Acceleration</a></strong>, from GPUs and TPUs in cloud environments to edge accelerators with constrained resources.</p>
<p>Although these applications differ in technical implementation, they share a common foundation: the adversary replaces a static exploit with a learned model capable of approximating or adapting to the target’s vulnerable behavior. This shift increases flexibility, reduces manual overhead, and improves robustness in the face of evolving or partially obscured defenses.</p>
<p>What makes this class of threats particularly significant is their favorable scaling behavior. Just as accuracy in computer vision or language modeling improves with additional data, larger architectures, and greater compute resources, so too does the performance of attack-oriented machine learning models. A model trained on larger corpora of phishing attempts or power traces, for instance, may generalize more effectively, evade more detectors, or require fewer inputs to succeed. The same ecosystem that drives innovation in beneficial AI, including public datasets, open-source tooling, and scalable infrastructure, also lowers the barrier to developing effective offensive models.</p>
<p>This dynamic creates an asymmetry between attacker and defender. While defensive measures are bounded by deployment constraints, latency budgets, and regulatory requirements, attackers can scale training pipelines with minimal marginal cost. The widespread availability of pretrained models and public ML platforms further reduces the expertise required to develop high-impact attacks.</p>
<p>Examining these offensive capabilities serves a crucial defensive purpose. Security professionals have long recognized that effective defense requires understanding attack methodologies—this principle underlies penetration testing<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>, red team exercises<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>, and threat modeling throughout the cybersecurity industry.</p>

The same computational advantages that make ML powerful for legitimate applications—pattern recognition, automation, and scalability—also enhance adversarial capabilities. By examining how machine learning can be weaponized, security professionals can anticipate attack vectors, design more robust defenses, and develop detection mechanisms.</p>
<p>As a result, any comprehensive treatment of machine learning system security must consider not only the vulnerabilities of ML systems themselves but also the ways in which machine learning can be used to compromise other components—whether software, data, or hardware. Understanding the offensive potential of machine-learned systems is essential for designing resilient, trustworthy, and forward-looking defenses.</p>

</div>
<p>As shown in <a href="#fig-side-channel-curves" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;11</a>, cryptographic computations exhibit data-dependent variations in their power consumption. These variations, while subtle, are measurable and reflect the internal state of the algorithm at specific points in time.</p>
<p>In traditional side-channel attacks, experts rely on statistical techniques to extract these differences. However, a neural network can learn to associate the shape of these signals with the specific data values being processed, effectively learning to decode the signal in a manner that mimics expert-crafted models, yet with enhanced flexibility and generalization. The model is trained on labeled examples of power traces and their corresponding intermediate values (e.g., output of an S-box operation). Over time, it learns to associate patterns in the trace, similar to those depicted in <a href="#fig-side-channel-curves" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;11</a>, with secret-dependent computational behavior. This transforms the key recovery task into a classification problem, where the goal is to infer the correct key byte based on trace shape alone.</p>
<p>In their study, <span class="citation" data-cites="scaaml_2019">Bursztein et al. (<a href="#ref-scaaml_2019" role="doc-biblioref">2024a</a>)</span> trained a convolutional neural network to extract AES keys from power traces collected on an STM32F415 microcontroller running the open-source TinyAES implementation. The model was trained to predict intermediate values of the AES algorithm, such as the output of the S-box in the first round, directly from raw power traces. The trained model recovered the full 128-bit key using only a small number of traces per byte.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-comprehensive-defense-architectures-48ab">Comprehensive Defense Architectures</h2>
<p>Having examined threats against ML systems and threats enabled by ML capabilities, we now turn to comprehensive defensive strategies. Designing secure and privacy-preserving machine learning systems requires more than identifying individual threats. It demands a layered defense strategy that integrates protections across multiple system levels to create comprehensive resilience.</p>
<p>This section progresses systematically through four layers of defense: Data Layer protections including differential privacy and secure computation that safeguard sensitive information during training; Model Layer defenses such as adversarial training and secure deployment that protect the models themselves; Runtime Layer measures including input validation and output monitoring that secure inference operations; and Hardware Layer foundations such as trusted execution environments that provide the trust anchor for all other protections. We conclude with practical frameworks for selecting and implementing these defenses based on your deployment context.</p>
<section id="sec-security-privacy-layered-defense-principle-8706" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-layered-defense-principle-8706">The Layered Defense Principle</h3>
<p>Layered defense (also known as defense-in-depth) represents a core security architecture principle where multiple independent defensive mechanisms work together to protect against diverse threat vectors. In machine learning systems, this approach becomes essential due to the unique attack surfaces introduced by data dependencies, model exposures, and inference patterns. Unlike traditional software systems that primarily face code-based vulnerabilities, ML systems are vulnerable to input manipulation, data leakage, model extraction, and runtime abuse, all amplified by tight coupling between data, model behavior, and infrastructure.</p>
<p>The layered approach recognizes that no single defensive mechanism can address all possible threats. Instead, security emerges from the interaction of complementary protections: data-layer techniques like differential privacy and federated learning; model-layer defenses including robustness techniques and secure deployment; runtime-layer measures such as input validation and output monitoring; and hardware-layer solutions including trusted execution environments and secure boot. Each layer contributes to the system’s overall resilience while compensating for potential weaknesses in other layers.</p>
<p>This section presents a structured framework implementing layered defense for ML systems, progressing from data-centric protections to infrastructure-level enforcement. The framework builds upon data protection practices in <strong><a href="../data_engineering/data_engineering.html#sec-data-engineering">Chapter 6: Data Engineering</a></strong> and connects forward to operational security measures detailed in <strong><a href="../ops/ops.html#sec-ml-operations">Chapter 13: ML Operations</a></strong>. By integrating safeguards across layers, organizations can build ML systems that not only perform reliably but also withstand adversarial pressure in production environments.</p>
<p>The layered approach is visualized in <a href="#fig-defense-stack" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;13</a>, which shows how defensive mechanisms progress from foundational hardware-based security to runtime system protections, model-level controls, and privacy-preserving techniques at the data level. Each layer builds on the trust guarantees of the layer below it, forming an end-to-end strategy for deploying ML systems securely.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-privacypreserving-data-techniques-64f8">Privacy-Preserving Data Techniques</h3>
<p>At the highest level of our defense stack, we begin with data privacy techniques. Protecting the privacy of individuals whose data fuels machine learning systems is a foundational requirement for trustworthy AI. Unlike traditional systems where data is often masked or anonymized before processing, ML workflows typically rely on access to raw, high-fidelity data to train effective models. This tension between utility and privacy has motivated a diverse set of techniques aimed at minimizing data exposure while preserving learning performance.</p>
<section id="sec-security-privacy-differential-privacy-8c2b" class="level4 page-columns page-full">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-differential-privacy-8c2b">Differential Privacy</h4>
<p>One of the most widely adopted frameworks for formalizing privacy guarantees is differential privacy (DP). DP provides a rigorous mathematical definition of privacy loss, ensuring that the inclusion or exclusion of a single individual’s data has a provably limited effect on the model’s output.</p>
<p>To understand the need for differential privacy, consider this challenge: how can we quantify privacy loss when learning from data? Traditional privacy approaches focus on removing identifying information (names, addresses, social security numbers) or applying statistical disclosure controls. However, these methods fail against sophisticated adversaries who can re-identify individuals through auxiliary data, statistical correlation attacks, or inference from model outputs.</p>
<p>Differential privacy takes a different approach by focusing on algorithmic behavior rather than data content. The key insight is that privacy protection should be measurable and should limit what can be learned about any individual, regardless of what external information an adversary possesses.</p>
<p>To build intuition for this concept, imagine you want to find the average salary of a group of people, but no one wants to reveal their actual salary. With differential privacy, you could ask everyone to write their salary on a piece of paper, but before they hand it in, they add or subtract a random number from a known distribution. When you average all the papers, the random noise tends to cancel out, giving you a very close estimate of the true average. However, if you pull out any single piece of paper, you cannot know the person’s real salary because you do not know what random number they added. This is the core idea: learn aggregate patterns while making it impossible to be sure about any single individual.</p>
<p>Differential privacy formalizes this intuition through a comparison of algorithm behavior on similar datasets. Consider two adjacent datasets that differ only in the presence or absence of a single individual’s record. Differential privacy ensures that the probability distributions of algorithm outputs remain statistically similar regardless of whether that individual’s data is included. This protection is achieved through carefully calibrated noise that masks individual contributions while preserving the aggregate statistical patterns necessary for machine learning.</p>
<p>To make this intuition mathematically precise, differential privacy introduces a quantitative measure of privacy loss. The mathematical framework uses probability ratios to bound how much an algorithm’s behavior can change when a single individual’s data is added or removed. This approach allows us to prove privacy guarantees rather than simply assume them.</p>
<p>A randomized algorithm <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> is said to be <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>-differentially private if, for all adjacent datasets <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D'\)</span> differing in one record, and for all outputs <span class="math inline">\(S \subseteq \text{Range}(\mathcal{A})\)</span>, the following holds: <span class="math display">\[
\Pr[\mathcal{A}(D) \in S] \leq e^{\epsilon} \Pr[\mathcal{A}(D') \in S]
\]</span></p>
<p>The parameter <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> quantifies the privacy budget, representing the maximum allowable privacy loss. Smaller values of <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> provide stronger privacy guarantees through increased noise injection, but may reduce model utility. Typical values include <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon = 0.1\)</span> for strong privacy protection, <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon = 1.0\)</span> for moderate protection, and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon = 10\)</span> for weaker but utility-preserving guarantees. The multiplicative factor <span class="math inline">\(e^{\epsilon}\)</span> bounds the likelihood ratio between algorithm outputs on adjacent datasets, constraining how much an individual’s participation can influence any particular result.</p>
<p>This bound ensures that the algorithm’s behavior remains statistically indistinguishable regardless of whether any individual’s data is present, thereby limiting the information that can be inferred about that individual. In practice, DP is implemented by adding calibrated noise to model updates or query responses, using mechanisms such as the Laplace or Gaussian mechanism. Training techniques like differentially private stochastic gradient descent<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> integrate calibrated noise into training computations, ensuring that individual data points cannot be distinguished from the model’s learned behavior.</p>

<p>While differential privacy adds mathematical guarantees to data processing, federated learning (FL) offers a complementary approach that reduces privacy risks by restructuring the learning process itself. This technique directly addresses the privacy challenges of on-device learning explored in <strong><a href="../ondevice_learning/ondevice_learning.html#sec-ondevice-learning">Chapter 14: On-Device Learning</a></strong>, where models must adapt to local data patterns without exposing sensitive user information. Rather than aggregating raw data at a central location, FL distributes the training across a set of client devices, each holding local data <span class="citation" data-cites="mcmahan2017communicationefficient">(<a href="#ref-mcmahan2017communicationefficient" role="doc-biblioref">McMahan et al. 2017</a>)</span>. This distributed training paradigm, which builds on the adaptive deployment concepts from on-device learning, requires careful coordination of security measures across multiple participants and infrastructure providers. Clients compute model updates locally and share only parameter deltas with a central server for aggregation: <span class="math display">\[

<p>Google’s Gboard keyboard uses federated learning to improve next-word prediction across 1+ billion Android devices without collecting typing data. The system works as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-synthetic-data-generation-4349">Synthetic Data Generation</h4>
<p>Beyond cryptographic approaches like homomorphic encryption, a more pragmatic and increasingly popular alternative involves the use of synthetic data generation<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a>. This approach offers an intuitive solution to privacy protection: if we can create artificial data that looks statistically similar to real data, we can train models without ever exposing sensitive information.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn40"><p><sup>40</sup>&nbsp;<strong>Synthetic Data Growth</strong>: The synthetic data market grew from $110 million in 2019 to $1.1 billion in 2023, driven by privacy regulations and data scarcity. Companies like Uber use synthetic trip data to protect user privacy while maintaining ML model performance, with some synthetic datasets achieving 95%+ statistical fidelity.</p></div></div><p>Synthetic data generation works by training a generative model (such as a GAN, VAE, or diffusion model) on the original sensitive dataset, then using this trained generator to produce new artificial samples. The key insight is that the generative model learns the underlying patterns and distributions in the data without memorizing specific individuals. When properly implemented, the synthetic data preserves statistical properties necessary for machine learning while removing personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>The generation typically follows three stages. First, distribution learning trains a generative model <span class="math inline">\(G_\theta\)</span> on real data <span class="math inline">\(D_{real} = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\}\)</span> to learn the data distribution <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span>. Second, synthetic sampling generates new samples <span class="math inline">\(D_{synthetic} = \{G_\theta(z_1), G_\theta(z_2), ..., G_\theta(z_m)\}\)</span> by sampling from random noise <span class="math inline">\(z_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,I)\)</span>. Third, validation verifies that <span class="math inline">\(D_{synthetic}\)</span> maintains statistical fidelity to <span class="math inline">\(D_{real}\)</span> while avoiding memorization of specific records. By training generative models on real datasets and sampling new instances from the learned distribution, organizations can create datasets that approximate the statistical properties of the original data without retaining identifiable details <span class="citation" data-cites="goncalves2020generation">(<a href="#ref-goncalves2020generation" role="doc-biblioref">Goncalves et al. 2020</a>)</span>.</p>

</div></div><p>While appealing, synthetic data generation faces important limitations. Generative models can suffer from mode collapse, failing to capture rare but important patterns in the original data. More critically, sophisticated adversaries can potentially extract information about the original training data through generative model inversion attacks or membership inference. The privacy protection depends heavily on the generative model architecture, training procedure, and hyperparameter choices—making it difficult to provide formal privacy guarantees without additional mechanisms like differential privacy.</p>
<p>Consider a practical example where a hospital wants to share patient data for ML research while protecting privacy. They train a generative adversarial network (GAN) on 10,000 real patient records containing demographics, lab results, and diagnoses. The GAN learns to generate synthetic patients with realistic combinations of features (e.g., diabetic patients typically have elevated glucose levels). The synthetic dataset of 50,000 artificial patients maintains clinical correlations necessary for training diagnostic models while containing no real patient information. However, the hospital also applies differential privacy during GAN training (ε = 1.0) to prevent the model from memorizing specific patients, trading a 5% reduction in statistical fidelity for formal privacy guarantees.</p>
<p>Together, these techniques reflect a shift from isolating data as the sole path to privacy toward embedding privacy-preserving mechanisms into the learning process itself. Each method offers distinct guarantees and trade-offs depending on the application context, threat model, and regulatory constraints. Effective system design often combines multiple approaches, such as applying differential privacy within a federated learning setup, or employing homomorphic encryption for important inference stages, to build ML systems that are both useful and respectful of user privacy.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-case-study-gpt3-data-extraction-attack-5126">Case Study: GPT-3 Data Extraction Attack</h3>
<p>In 2020, researchers conducted a groundbreaking study demonstrating that large language models could leak sensitive training data through carefully crafted prompts <span class="citation" data-cites="carlini2021extracting">(<a href="#ref-carlini2021extracting" role="doc-biblioref">Carlini et al. 2021</a>)</span>. The research team systematically queried OpenAI’s GPT-3 model to extract verbatim content from its training dataset, revealing privacy vulnerabilities in large-scale language models.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"></div><p>The attack proved remarkably successful at extracting sensitive information directly from the model’s outputs. By repeatedly querying the model with prompts like “My name is” followed by attempts to continue famous quotes or repeated phrases, researchers successfully extracted personal information including email addresses and phone numbers from the training data, verbatim passages from copyrighted books, private data that should have been filtered during training, and personally identifiable information from millions of individuals.</p>
<p>The technical approach exploited GPT-3’s memorization of rare or repeated text sequences. The researchers used prompt engineering to craft inputs that triggered memorized sequences, continuation attacks that used partial quotes or names to extract full sensitive information, statistical analysis to identify patterns in model outputs indicating verbatim memorization, and verification methods that cross-referenced extracted data with known public sources to confirm accuracy. Out of 600,000 attempts, they successfully extracted over 16,000 unique instances of memorized training data.</p>
<p>This attack challenged assumptions about training data privacy. The results demonstrated that large language models can act as unintentional databases, storing and retrieving sensitive information from their training data. This violated privacy expectations that training data would be “forgotten” after model training, revealing that scale amplifies privacy risk as larger models (175B parameters) memorize more training data than smaller models.</p>
<p>The research revealed that common data protection measures proved insufficient. Even after data deduplication, models still memorized sensitive information, highlighting the tension between model utility and privacy protection. Techniques to prevent memorization such as differential privacy and aggressive data filtering reduce model quality, creating challenging trade-offs for practitioners.</p>
<p>The industry response was swift and comprehensive. Organizations began widespread adoption of differential privacy in large model training, enhanced data filtering and PII removal processes, development of membership inference defenses, new research into machine unlearning techniques, and regulatory discussions about training data rights and model transparency. Modern organizations now commonly implement differential privacy during training (ε ≤ 8), aggressive PII filtering using automated detection tools, regular auditing for data memorization using extraction attacks, and legal frameworks for handling training data containing personal information <span class="citation" data-cites="carlini2021extracting">(<a href="#ref-carlini2021extracting" role="doc-biblioref">Carlini et al. 2021</a>)</span>.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-secure-model-design-69a6">Secure Model Design</h3>
<p>Moving from data-level protections to model-level security, we address how security considerations shape the model development process. Security begins at the design phase of a machine learning system. While downstream mechanisms such as access control and encryption protect models once deployed, many vulnerabilities can be mitigated earlier—through architectural choices, defensive training strategies, and mechanisms that embed resilience directly into the model’s structure or behavior. By considering security as a design constraint, system developers can reduce the model’s exposure to attacks, limit its ability to leak sensitive information, and provide verifiable ownership protection.</p>
<p>One important design strategy is to build robust-by-construction models that reduce the risk of exploitation at inference time. For instance, models with confidence calibration or abstention mechanisms can be trained to avoid making predictions when input uncertainty is high. These techniques can help prevent overconfident misclassifications in response to adversarial or out-of-distribution inputs. Models may also employ output smoothing, regularizing the output distribution to reduce sharp decision boundaries that are especially susceptible to adversarial perturbations.</p>
<p>Certain application contexts may also benefit from choosing simpler or compressed architectures. Limiting model capacity can reduce opportunities for memorization of sensitive training data and complicate efforts to reverse-engineer the model from output behavior. For embedded or on-device settings, smaller models are also easier to secure, as they typically require less memory and compute, lowering the likelihood of side-channel leakage or runtime manipulation.</p>
<p>Another design-stage consideration is the use of model watermarking<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a>, a technique for embedding verifiable ownership signatures directly into the model’s parameters or output behavior <span class="citation" data-cites="adi2018turning">(<a href="#ref-adi2018turning" role="doc-biblioref">Adi et al. 2018</a>)</span>. A watermark might be implemented, for example, as a hidden response pattern triggered by specific inputs, or as a parameter-space perturbation that does not affect accuracy but is statistically identifiable.</p>

</div></div><p>For example, in a keyword spotting system deployed on embedded hardware for voice activation (e.g., “Hey Alexa” or “OK Google”), a secure design might use a lightweight convolutional neural network with confidence calibration to avoid false activations on uncertain audio. The model might also include an abstention threshold, below which it produces no activation at all. To protect intellectual property, a designer could embed a watermark by training the model to respond with a unique label only when presented with a specific, unused audio trigger known only to the developer. These design choices not only improve robustness and accountability, but also support future verification in case of IP disputes or performance failures in the field.</p>
<p>In high-risk applications, such as medical diagnosis, autonomous vehicles, or financial decision systems, designers may also prioritize interpretable model architectures, such as decision trees, rule-based classifiers, or sparsified networks, to enhance system auditability. These models are often easier to understand and explain, making it simpler to identify potential vulnerabilities or biases. Using interpretable models allows developers to provide clearer insights into how the system arrived at a particular decision, which is important for building trust with users and regulators.</p>
<p>Model design choices often reflect trade-offs between accuracy, robustness, transparency, and system complexity. When viewed from a systems perspective, early-stage design decisions yield the highest value for long-term security. They shape what the model can learn, how it behaves under uncertainty, and what guarantees can be made about its provenance, interpretability, and resilience.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-secure-model-deployment-e08c">Secure Model Deployment</h3>
<p>While secure design establishes a foundation of robustness, protection extends beyond the model itself to how it is packaged and deployed. Protecting machine learning models from theft, abuse, and unauthorized manipulation requires security considerations throughout both the design and deployment phases. A model’s vulnerability is not solely determined by its training procedure or architecture, but also by how it is serialized, packaged, deployed, and accessed during inference. As models are increasingly embedded into edge devices, served through public APIs, or integrated into multi-tenant platforms, robust security practices are important to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of model behavior.</p>
<p>This section addresses security mechanisms across three key stages: model design, secure packaging and serialization, and deployment and access control. These practices complement the model optimization techniques discussed in <strong><a href="../optimizations/optimizations.html#sec-model-optimizations">Chapter 10: Model Optimizations</a></strong>, where performance improvements must not compromise security properties.</p>
<p>From a design perspective, architectural choices can reduce a model’s exposure to adversarial manipulation and unauthorized use. For example, models can incorporate confidence calibration or abstention mechanisms that allow them to reject uncertain or anomalous inputs rather than producing potentially misleading outputs. Designing models with simpler or compressed architectures can also reduce the risk of reverse engineering or information leakage through side-channel analysis. In some cases, model designers may embed imperceptible watermarks, which are unique signatures embedded in the parameters or behavior of the model, that can later be used to demonstrate ownership in cases of misappropriation <span class="citation" data-cites="uchida2017embedding">(<a href="#ref-uchida2017embedding" role="doc-biblioref">Uchida et al. 2017</a>)</span>.

</div></div><p>Once training is complete, the model must be securely packaged for deployment. Storing models in plaintext formats, including unencrypted ONNX or PyTorch checkpoint files, can expose internal structures and parameters to attackers with access to the file system or memory. To mitigate this risk, models should be encrypted, obfuscated, or wrapped in secure containers. Decryption keys should be made available only at runtime and only within trusted environments. Additional mechanisms, such as quantization-aware encryption or integrity-checking wrappers, can prevent tampering and offline model theft.</p>
<p>Deployment environments must also enforce strong access control policies to ensure that only authorized users and services can interact with inference endpoints. Authentication protocols, including OAuth<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> tokens, mutual TLS<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a>, or API keys<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a>, should be combined with role-based access control (RBAC)<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> to restrict access according to user roles and operational context. For instance, OpenAI’s hosted model APIs require users to include an OPENAI_API_KEY when submitting inference requests.</p>

Additional security measures in production deployments typically include model integrity verification through SHA-256 hash checking, rate limiting to prevent abuse, input validation for size and format constraints, and comprehensive logging for security event tracking.</p>
<p>The secure deployment patterns established here integrate naturally with the development workflows explored in <strong><a href="../workflow/workflow.html#sec-ai-workflow">Chapter 5: AI Workflow</a></strong>, ensuring security becomes part of standard engineering practice rather than an afterthought. Runtime monitoring (<a href="#sec-security-privacy-runtime-system-monitoring-a71c" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;1.8.6</a>) extends these protections to operational environments.</p>

<p>While secure design and deployment establish strong foundations, protection must extend to runtime operations. Even with robust design and deployment safeguards, machine learning systems remain vulnerable to runtime threats. Attackers may craft inputs that bypass validation, exploit model behavior, or target system-level infrastructure.</p>
<p>Production ML systems face diverse deployment contexts—from cloud services to edge devices to embedded systems. Each environment presents unique monitoring challenges and opportunities, as the system architectures from <strong><a href="../ml_systems/ml_systems.html#sec-ml-systems">Chapter 2: ML Systems</a></strong> demonstrate. Defensive strategies must extend beyond static protection to include real-time monitoring, threat detection, and incident response. This section outlines operational defenses that maintain system trust under adversarial conditions, connecting forward to the comprehensive MLOps practices detailed in <strong><a href="../ops/ops.html#sec-ml-operations">Chapter 13: ML Operations</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Runtime monitoring encompasses a range of techniques for observing system behavior, detecting anomalies, and triggering mitigation. These techniques can be grouped into three categories: input validation, output monitoring, and system integrity checks.</p>
<section id="sec-security-privacy-input-validation-c96f" class="level4 page-columns page-full">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-input-validation-c96f">Input Validation</h4>
<p>Input validation is the first line of defense at runtime. It ensures that incoming data conforms to expected formats, statistical properties, or semantic constraints before it is passed to a machine learning model. Without these safeguards, models are vulnerable to adversarial inputs, which are crafted examples designed to trigger incorrect predictions, or to malformed inputs that cause unexpected behavior in preprocessing or inference.</p>
<p>Machine learning models, unlike traditional rule-based systems, often do not fail safely. Small, carefully chosen changes to input data can cause models to make high-confidence but incorrect predictions. Input validation helps detect and reject such inputs early in the pipeline <span class="citation" data-cites="goodfellow2015explaining">(<a href="#ref-goodfellow2015explaining" role="doc-biblioref">Goodfellow, Shlens, and Szegedy 2014</a>)</span>.</p>

</div><div id="fn46"><p><sup>46</sup>&nbsp;<strong>Speech Activity Detector (SAD)</strong>: Algorithm that distinguishes speech from silence, noise, or music in audio streams, essential for voice interfaces since the 1990s. Modern neural SADs achieve 95%+ accuracy and operate in &lt;10ms latency, enabling real-time filtering before expensive speech recognition processing.</p></div></div><p>Validation techniques range from low-level checks (e.g., input size, type, and value ranges) to semantic filters (e.g., verifying whether an image contains a recognizable object or whether a voice recording includes speech). For example, a facial recognition system might validate that the uploaded image is within a certain resolution range (e.g., 224×224 to 1024×1024 pixels), contains RGB channels, and passes a lightweight face detection filter. This prevents inputs like blank images, text screenshots, or synthetic adversarial patterns from reaching the model. Similarly, a voice assistant might require that incoming audio files be between 1 and 5 seconds long, have a valid sampling rate (e.g., 16kHz), and contain detectable human speech using a speech activity detector (SAD)<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>. This ensures that empty recordings, music clips, or noise bursts are filtered before model inference.</p>
<p>In generative systems such as DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, or Sora, input validation often involves prompt filtering. This includes scanning the user’s text prompt for banned terms, brand names, profanity, or misleading medical claims. For example, a user prompt like “Generate an image of a medication bottle labeled with Pfizer’s logo” might be rejected or rewritten due to trademark concerns. Filters may operate using keyword lists, regular expressions, or lightweight classifiers that assess prompt intent. These filters prevent the generative model from being used to produce harmful, illegal, or misleading content—even before sampling begins.</p>
<p>In some applications, distributional checks are also used. These assess whether the incoming data statistically resembles what the model saw during training. For instance, a computer vision pipeline might compare the color histogram of the input image to a baseline distribution, flagging outliers for manual review or rejection.</p>
<p>These validations can be lightweight (heuristics or threshold rules) or learned (small models trained to detect distribution shift or adversarial artifacts). In either case, input validation serves as a important pre-inference firewall—reducing exposure to adversarial behavior, improving system stability, and increasing trust in downstream model decisions.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-security-privacy-output-monitoring-cf37" class="level4 page-columns page-full">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-output-monitoring-cf37">Output Monitoring</h4>
<p>Even when inputs pass validation, adversarial or unexpected behavior may still emerge at the model’s output. Output monitoring helps detect such anomalies by analyzing model predictions in real time. These mechanisms observe how the model behaves across inputs, by tracking its confidence, prediction entropy, class distribution, or response patterns, to flag deviations from expected behavior.</p>
<p>A key target for monitoring is prediction confidence. For example, if a classification model begins assigning high confidence to low-frequency or previously rare classes, this may indicate the presence of adversarial inputs or a shift in the underlying data distribution. Monitoring the entropy of the output distribution can similarly reveal when the model is overly certain in ambiguous contexts—an early signal of possible manipulation.</p>
<p>In content moderation systems, a model that normally outputs neutral or “safe” labels may suddenly begin producing high-confidence “safe” labels for inputs containing offensive or restricted content. Output monitoring can detect this mismatch by comparing predictions against auxiliary signals or known-safe reference sets. When deviations are detected, the system may trigger a fallback policy—such as escalating the content for human review or switching to a conservative baseline model.</p>
<p>Time-series models also benefit from output monitoring. For instance, an anomaly detection model used in fraud detection might track predicted fraud scores for sequences of financial transactions. A sudden drop in fraud scores, especially during periods of high transaction volume, may indicate model tampering, label leakage, or evasion attempts. Monitoring the temporal evolution of predictions provides a broader perspective than static, pointwise classification.</p>
<p>Generative models, such as text-to-image systems, introduce unique output monitoring challenges. These models can produce high-fidelity imagery that may inadvertently violate content safety policies, platform guidelines, or user expectations. To mitigate these risks, post-generation classifiers are commonly employed to assess generated content for objectionable characteristics such as violence, nudity, or brand misuse. These classifiers operate downstream of the generative model and can suppress, blur, or reject outputs based on predefined thresholds. Some systems also inspect internal representations (e.g., attention maps<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> or latent embeddings) to anticipate potential misuse before content is rendered.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn47"><p><sup>47</sup>&nbsp;<strong>Attention Maps</strong>: Visualization technique for understanding transformer model focus, introduced with the attention mechanism in 2015. Attention maps reveal which input tokens influence outputs most strongly, helping detect potential bias or manipulation in models processing 175+ billion parameters like GPT-3.</p></div></div><p>However, prompt filtering alone is insufficient for safety. Research has shown that text-to-image systems can be manipulated through implicitly adversarial prompts, which are queries that appear benign but lead to policy-violating outputs. The Adversarial Nibbler project introduces an open red teaming methodology that identifies such prompts and demonstrates how models like Stable Diffusion can produce unintended content despite the absence of explicit trigger phrases <span class="citation" data-cites="quaye2024adversarial">(<a href="#ref-quaye2024adversarial" role="doc-biblioref">Quaye et al. 2024</a>)</span>. These failure cases often bypass prompt filters because their risk arises from model behavior during generation, not from syntactic or lexical cues.</p>

<p>As shown in <a href="#fig-adversarial-nibbler" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;14</a>, even prompts that appear innocuous can trigger unsafe generations. Such examples highlight the limitations of pre-generation safety checks and reinforce the necessity of output-based monitoring as a second line of defense. This two-stage pipeline—consisting of prompt filtering followed by post-hoc content analysisis important for ensuring the safe deployment of generative models in open-ended or user-facing environments.</p>
<p>In the domain of language generation, output monitoring plays a different but equally important role. Here, the goal is often to detect toxicity, hallucinated claims, or off-distribution responses. For example, a customer support chatbot may be monitored for keyword presence, tonal alignment, or semantic coherence. If a response contains profanity, unsupported assertions, or syntactically malformed text, the system may trigger a rephrasing, initiate a fallback to scripted templates, or halt the response altogether.</p>
<p>Effective output monitoring combines rule-based heuristics with learned detectors trained on historical outputs. These detectors are deployed to flag deviations in real time and feed alerts into incident response pipelines. In contrast to model-centric defenses like adversarial training, which aim to improve model robustness, output monitoring emphasizes containment and remediation. Its role is not to prevent exploitation but to detect its symptoms and initiate appropriate countermeasures <span class="citation" data-cites="savas2022ml">(<a href="#ref-savas2022ml" role="doc-biblioref">Savas et al. 2022</a>)</span>.

<section id="sec-security-privacy-integrity-checks-2989" class="level4 page-columns page-full">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-integrity-checks-2989">Integrity Checks</h4>
<p>While input and output monitoring focus on model behavior, system integrity checks ensure that the underlying model files, execution environment, and serving infrastructure remain untampered throughout deployment. These checks detect unauthorized modifications, verify that the model running in production is authentic, and alert operators to suspicious system-level activity.</p>
<p>One of the most common integrity mechanisms is cryptographic model verification. Before a model is loaded into memory, the system can compute a cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256)<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> of the model file and compare it against a known-good signature.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn48"><p><sup>48</sup>&nbsp;<strong>SHA-256</strong>: Cryptographic hash function producing 256-bit digests, part of the SHA-2 family designed by the NSA in 2001. Despite processing trillions of hashes daily across Bitcoin mining and digital signatures, no practical collision attacks exist after 20+ years, making it the gold standard for file integrity verification.</p></div></div><p>Access control and audit logging complement cryptographic checks. ML systems should restrict access to model files using role-based permissions and monitor file access patterns. For instance, repeated attempts to read model checkpoints from a non-standard path, or inference requests from unauthorized IP ranges, may indicate tampering, privilege escalation, or insider threats.</p>
<p>In cloud environments, container- or VM-based isolation<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> helps enforce process and memory boundaries, but these protections can erode over time due to misconfiguration or supply chain vulnerabilities.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn49"><p><sup>49</sup>&nbsp;<strong>Container/VM Isolation</strong>: Virtualization technologies that provide process and memory separation—containers (Docker, 2013) offer lightweight OS-level isolation with typically 0-5% overhead for CPU-bound workloads and 2-10% for I/O-intensive operations, while VMs provide stronger hardware-level isolation with 10-15% overhead. In ML deployments, containerization is widely adopted for model serving, with industry surveys suggesting 80-90% adoption in cloud environments, though VMs remain preferred for sensitive models requiring stronger isolation guarantees.</p></div><div id="fn50"><p><sup>50</sup>&nbsp;<strong>Healthcare ML Compliance</strong>: FDA has approved 500+ AI-based medical devices since 2016, requiring strict validation under 21 CFR Part 820 quality systems.

For ML systems, HIPAA requires encryption of data at rest and in transit, audit logs for all data access, and business associate agreements for cloud ML services, with violations carrying fines up to $1.5 million per incident.</p></div></div><p>For example, in a regulated healthcare ML deployment<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a>, integrity checks might include: verifying the model hash against a signed manifest, validating that the runtime environment uses only approved Python packages, and checking that inference occurs inside a signed and attested virtual machine. These checks ensure compliance with regulations like HIPAA<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a>’s integrity requirements and GDPR’s accountability principle, limit the risk of silent failures, and create a forensic trail in case of audit or breach.</p>
<p>Some systems also implement runtime memory verification, such as scanning for unexpected model parameter changes or checking that memory-mapped model weights remain unaltered during execution. While more common in high-assurance systems, such checks are becoming more feasible with the adoption of secure enclaves and trusted runtimes.</p>
<p>Taken together, system integrity checks play a important role in protecting machine learning systems from low-level attacks that bypass the model interface. When coupled with input/output monitoring, they provide layered assurance that both the model and its execution environment remain trustworthy under adversarial conditions.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-security-privacy-response-rollback-1792" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-response-rollback-1792">Response and Rollback</h4>
<p>When a security breach, anomaly, or performance degradation is detected in a deployed machine learning system, rapid and structured incident response is important to minimizing impact. The goal is not only to contain the issue but to restore system integrity and ensure that future deployments benefit from the insights gained. Unlike traditional software systems, ML responses may require handling model state, data drift, or inference behavior, making recovery more complex.</p>
<p>The first step is to define incident detection thresholds that trigger escalation. These thresholds may come from input validation (e.g., invalid input rates), output monitoring (e.g., drop in prediction confidence), or system integrity checks (e.g., failed model signature verification). When a threshold is crossed, the system should initiate an automated or semi-automated response protocol.</p>
<p>One common strategy is model rollback, where the system reverts to a previously verified version of the model. For instance, if a newly deployed fraud detection model begins misclassifying transactions, the system may fall back to the last known-good checkpoint, restoring service while the affected version is quarantined. Rollback mechanisms require version-controlled model storage, typically supported by MLOps platforms such as MLflow, TFX, or SageMaker.</p>
<p>In high-availability environments, model isolation may be used to contain failures. The affected model instance can be removed from load balancers or shadowed in a canary deployment setup. This allows continued service with unaffected replicas while maintaining forensic access to the compromised model for analysis.</p>
<p>Traffic throttling is another immediate response tool. If an adversarial actor is probing a public inference API at high volume, the system can rate-limit or temporarily block offending IP ranges while continuing to serve trusted clients. This containment technique helps prevent abuse without requiring full system shutdown.</p>
<p>Once immediate containment is in place, investigation and recovery can begin. This may include forensic analysis of input logs, parameter deltas between model versions, or memory snapshots from inference containers. In regulated environments, organizations may also need to notify users or auditors, particularly if personal or safety-important data was affected.</p>
<p>Recovery typically involves retraining or patching the model. This must occur through a secure update process, using signed artifacts, trusted build pipelines, and validated data. To prevent recurrence, the incident should feed back into model evaluation pipelines—updating tests, refining monitoring thresholds, or hardening input defenses. For example, if a prompt injection attack bypassed a content filter in a generative model, retraining might include adversarially crafted prompts, and the prompt validation logic would be updated to reflect newly discovered patterns.</p>
<p>Finally, organizations should establish post-incident review practices. This includes documenting root causes, identifying gaps in detection or response, and updating policies and playbooks. Incident reviews help translate operational failures into actionable improvements across the design-deploy-monitor lifecycle.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-hardware-security-foundations-f5e8">Hardware Security Foundations</h3>
<p>The software-layer defenses we’ve explored—input validation, output monitoring, and integrity checks—establish important protections, but they ultimately depend on the underlying hardware and firmware being trustworthy. If an attacker compromises the operating system, gains physical access to the device, or exploits vulnerabilities in the processor itself, these software defenses can be bypassed or disabled entirely. This limitation motivates hardware-based security mechanisms that operate below the software layer, creating a hardware root of trust that remains secure even when higher-level systems are compromised.</p>
<p>At the foundational level of our defensive framework, hardware-based security mechanisms provide the trust anchor for all higher-layer protections. Machine learning systems deployed in edge devices, embedded systems, and untrusted cloud infrastructure increasingly rely on hardware-based security features to establish this foundation. The hardware acceleration platforms discussed in <strong><a href="../hw_acceleration/hw_acceleration.html#sec-ai-acceleration">Chapter 11: AI Acceleration</a></strong>—including GPUs, TPUs, and specialized ML accelerators—often incorporate these security features (secure enclaves, trusted execution environments, hardware cryptographic units), while edge deployment scenarios from <strong><a href="../ondevice_learning/ondevice_learning.html#sec-ondevice-learning">Chapter 14: On-Device Learning</a></strong> present unique security challenges.</p>
<p>These hardware security mechanisms become particularly crucial when systems must meet regulatory compliance requirements. Healthcare ML systems handling protected health information under HIPAA must implement “appropriate technical safeguards” including access controls and encryption. Systems processing EU citizens’ data under GDPR must demonstrate “appropriate technical and organizational measures” with privacy by design principles embedded at the hardware level.</p>
<p>To understand how hardware security protects ML systems, imagine building a secure fortress for your most valuable assets. Each hardware security primitive serves a distinct defensive role:</p>

<p>These mechanisms work together to create comprehensive protection that begins in hardware and extends through all software layers.</p>
<p>This section explores how these four complementary hardware primitives work together to create comprehensive protection (<a href="#tbl-hardware-security-mechanisms" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;8</a>). Each mechanism addresses different security challenges but works most effectively when combined: secure boot establishes initial trust, TEEs provide runtime isolation, HSMs handle cryptographic operations, and PUFs enable device-unique authentication. We begin with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), which provide isolated runtime environments for sensitive computations. Secure Boot ensures system integrity from power-on, creating the trusted foundation that TEEs depend upon. Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) offer specialized cryptographic processing and tamper-resistant key storage, often required for regulatory compliance. Finally, Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) provide device-unique identities that enable lightweight authentication and cannot be cloned or extracted.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-hardwaresoftware-codesign-bed2">Hardware-Software Co-Design</h4>
<p>Modern ML systems require holistic analysis of security trade-offs across the entire hardware-software stack, similar to how we analyze compute-memory-energy trade-offs in performance optimization. The interdependence between hardware security features and software defenses creates both opportunities and constraints that must be understood quantitatively.</p>
<p>Hardware security mechanisms introduce measurable overhead that must be factored into system design. ARM TrustZone world-switching adds approximately 300-1000 cycles depending on processor generation and cache state (0.6-2.0μs at 500MHz) of latency per transition between secure and non-secure worlds. Cryptographic operations in secure mode typically consume 15-30% additional power compared to normal execution, impacting battery life in mobile ML applications. Intel SGX context switching imposes 15-30μs overhead per inference, representing 2% energy overhead for typical edge ML workloads.</p>
<p>Security features scale differently than computational resources. TEE memory limitations constrain model size regardless of available system memory. A quantized ResNet-18 model (47MB) can operate within ARM TrustZone constraints, while ResNet-50 (176MB) requires careful memory management or model partitioning. These constraints create architectural decisions that must be made early in system design.</p>
<p>Different threat models and protection levels require quantitative trade-off analysis. For ML workloads requiring cryptographic verification, AES-256 operations add 0.1-0.5ms per inference depending on model size and hardware acceleration availability. Homomorphic encryption operations impose 100-100,000x computational overhead, with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) at the higher end and somewhat homomorphic encryption (SHE) at the lower end, making them viable only for small models or offline scenarios where strong privacy guarantees justify the performance cost.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-trusted-execution-environments-80ed">Trusted Execution Environments</h4>
<p>A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a> is a hardware-isolated region within a processor designed to protect sensitive computations and data from potentially compromised software. TEEs enforce confidentiality, integrity, and runtime isolation, ensuring that even if the host operating system or application layer is attacked, sensitive operations within the TEE remain secure.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn52"><p><sup>52</sup>&nbsp;<strong>TEE Concept Origins</strong>: The idea emerged from ARM’s TrustZone development in the early 2000s, inspired by the military concept of “compartmentalized information.” ARM realized that mobile devices needed secure and non-secure “worlds” running on the same processor—leading to hardware-enforced isolation that became the template for all modern TEEs.]</p></div></div><p>In the context of machine learning, TEEs are increasingly important for preserving the confidentiality of models, securing sensitive user data during inference, and ensuring that model outputs remain trustworthy. For example, a TEE can protect model parameters from being extracted by malicious software running on the same device, or ensure that computations involving biometric inputs, including facial data or fingerprint data, are performed securely. This capability is essential in applications where model integrity, user privacy, or regulatory compliance are non-negotiable.</p>
<p>One widely deployed example is <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/secure-enclave-sec59b0b31ff/web">Apple’s Secure Enclave</a>, which provides isolated execution and secure key storage for iOS devices. By separating cryptographic operations and biometric data from the main processor, the Secure Enclave ensures that user credentials and Face ID features remain protected, even in the event of a broader system compromise.</p>
<p>Trusted Execution Environments are important across a range of industries with high security requirements. In telecommunications, TEEs are used to safeguard encryption keys and secure important 5G control-plane operations. In finance, they allow secure mobile payments and protect PIN-based authentication workflows. In healthcare, TEEs help enforce patient data confidentiality during edge-based ML inference on wearable or diagnostic devices. In the automotive industry, they are deployed in advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) to ensure that safety-important perception and decision-making modules operate on verified software.</p>
<p>In machine learning systems, TEEs can provide several important protections. They secure the execution of model inference or training, shielding intermediate computations and final predictions from system-level observation. They protect the confidentiality of sensitive inputs, including biometric or clinical signals, used in personal identification or risk scoring tasks. TEEs also serve to prevent reverse engineering of deployed models by restricting access to weights and architecture internals. When models are updated, TEEs ensure the authenticity of new parameters and block unauthorized tampering. In distributed ML settings, TEEs can protect data exchanged between components by enabling encrypted and attested communication channels.</p>
<p>The core security properties of a TEE are achieved through four mechanisms: isolated execution, secure storage, integrity protection, and in-TEE data encryption. Code that runs inside the TEE is executed in a separate processor mode, inaccessible to the normal-world operating system. Sensitive assets such as cryptographic keys or authentication tokens are stored in memory that only the TEE can access. Code and data can be verified for integrity before execution using hardware-anchored hashes or signatures. Finally, data processed inside the TEE can be encrypted, ensuring that even intermediate results are inaccessible without appropriate keys, which are also managed internally by the TEE.</p>
<p>Several commercial platforms provide TEE functionality tailored for different deployment contexts. <a href="https://www.arm.com/technologies/trustzone-for-cortex-m">ARM TrustZone</a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> offers secure and normal world execution on ARM-based systems and is widely used in mobile and IoT applications. <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/software-guard-extensions.html">Intel SGX</a><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a> implements enclave-based security for cloud and desktop systems, enabling secure computation even on untrusted infrastructure. <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/features/mobile-security-solutions">Qualcomm’s Secure Execution Environment</a> supports secure mobile transactions and user authentication. Apple’s Secure Enclave remains a canonical example of a hardware-isolated security coprocessor for consumer devices.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn53"><p><sup>53</sup>&nbsp;<strong>ARM TrustZone</strong>: Introduced in 2004, TrustZone now ships in 95% of ARM processors, protecting over 5 billion mobile devices.

For ML workloads, a ResNet-50 requires approximately 98MB for weights alone in FP32 format (25.6M parameters × 4 bytes), consuming 77% of SGX EPC before any intermediate activations. Inference latency increases from 5ms to 150ms when model exceeds EPC capacity.

The enclave includes a dedicated processor, an AES engine, a true random number generator (TRNG), a public key accelerator (PKA), and a secure I²C interface to nonvolatile storage. These components operate in isolation from the main application processor and memory subsystem. A memory protection engine enforces access control, while cryptographic operations such as NAND flash encryption are handled internally using enclave-managed keys. By physically separating secure execution and key management from the main system, this architecture limits the impact of system-level compromises and establishes hardware-enforced trust.</p>

<p>This architecture underpins the secure deployment of machine learning applications on consumer devices. For example, Apple’s Face ID system uses a secure enclave to perform facial recognition entirely within a hardware-isolated environment. The face embedding model is executed inside the enclave, and biometric templates are stored in secure nonvolatile memory accessible only via the enclave’s I²C interface. During authentication, input data from the infrared camera is processed locally, and no facial features or predictions ever leave the secure region. Even if the application processor or operating system is compromised, the enclave prevents access to sensitive model inputs, parameters, and outputs—ensuring that biometric identity remains protected end to end.</p>
<p>Despite their strengths, Trusted Execution Environments come with notable trade-offs. Implementing a TEE increases both direct hardware costs and indirect costs associated with developing and maintaining secure software. Integrating TEEs into existing systems may require architectural redesigns, especially for legacy infrastructure. Developers must adhere to strict protocols for isolation, attestation, and secure update management, which can extend development cycles and complicate testing workflows. TEEs can also introduce performance overhead, particularly when cryptographic operations are involved, or when context switching between trusted and untrusted modes is frequent.</p>
<p>Energy efficiency is another consideration, particularly in battery-constrained devices. TEEs typically consume additional power due to secure memory accesses, cryptographic computation, and hardware protection logic. In resource-limited embedded systems, these costs may limit their use. In terms of scalability and flexibility, the secure boundaries enforced by TEEs may complicate distributed training or federated inference workloads, where secure coordination between enclaves is required.</p>
<p>Market demand also varies. In some consumer applications, perceived threat levels may be too low to justify the integration of TEEs. Systems with TEEs may be subject to formal security certifications, such as <a href="https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/ccra/index.cfm">Common Criteria</a> or evaluation under <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/">ENISA</a>, which can introduce additional time and expense. For this reason, TEEs are typically adopted only when the expected threat model, including adversarial users, cloud tenants, and malicious insiders, justifies the investment.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, TEEs remain a powerful hardware primitive in the machine learning security landscape. When paired with software- and system-level defenses, they provide a trusted foundation for executing ML models securely, privately, and verifiably, especially in scenarios where adversarial compromise of the host environment is a serious concern.</p>
<p>Here is the revised 7.5.2 Secure Boot section, rewritten in formal textbook tone with all original technical content, hyperlinks, and figures preserved. The structure emphasizes narrative clarity, avoids bullet lists, and integrates the Apple Face ID case study naturally.</p>

<section id="sec-security-privacy-secure-boot-5242" class="level4 page-columns page-full">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-secure-boot-5242">Secure Boot</h4>
<p>Secure Boot is a mechanism that ensures a device only boots software components that are cryptographically verified and explicitly authorized by the manufacturer. At startup, each stage of the boot process, comprising the bootloader, kernel, and base operating system, is checked against a known-good digital signature. If any signature fails verification, the boot sequence is halted, preventing unauthorized or malicious code from executing. This chain-of-trust model establishes system integrity from the very first instruction executed.</p>
<p>In ML systems, especially those deployed on embedded or edge hardware, Secure Boot plays an important role. A compromised boot process may result in malicious software loading before the ML runtime begins, enabling attackers to intercept model weights, tamper with training data, or reroute inference results. Such breaches can lead to incorrect or manipulated predictions, unauthorized data access, or device repurposing for botnets or crypto-mining.</p>
<p>For machine learning systems, Secure Boot offers several guarantees. First, it protects model-related data, such as training data, inference inputs, and outputs, during the boot sequence, preventing pre-runtime tampering. Second, it ensures that only authenticated model binaries and supporting software are loaded, which helps guard against deployment-time model substitution. Third, Secure Boot allows secure model updates by verifying that firmware or model changes are signed and have not been altered in transit.</p>
<p>Secure Boot frequently works in tandem with hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to create a fully trusted execution stack. As shown in <a href="#fig-secure-boot" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;16</a>, this layered boot process verifies firmware, operating system components, and TEE integrity before permitting execution of cryptographic operations or ML workloads. In embedded systems, this architecture provides resilience even under severe adversarial conditions or physical device compromise.</p>

<p>A well-known real-world implementation of Secure Boot appears in Apple’s Face ID system, which uses advanced machine learning for facial recognition. For Face ID to operate securely, the entire device stack, from the initial power-on to the execution of the model, must be verifiably trusted.</p>
<p>Upon device startup, Secure Boot initiates within Apple’s <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102381">Secure Enclave</a>, a dedicated security coprocessor that handles biometric data. The firmware loaded onto the Secure Enclave is digitally signed by Apple, and any unauthorized modification causes the boot process to fail. Once verified, the Secure Enclave performs continuous checks in coordination with the central processor to maintain a trusted boot chain. Each system component, ranging from the iOS kernel to the application-level code, is verified using cryptographic signatures.</p>
<p>After completing the secure boot sequence, the Secure Enclave activates the ML-based Face ID system. The facial recognition model projects over 30,000 infrared points to map a user’s face, generating a depth image and computing a mathematical representation that is compared against a securely stored profile. These facial data artifacts are never written to disk, transmitted off-device, or shared externally. All processing occurs within the enclave to protect against eavesdropping or exfiltration, even in the presence of a compromised kernel.</p>
<p>To support continued integrity, Secure Boot also governs software updates. Only firmware or model updates signed by Apple are accepted, ensuring that even over-the-air patches do not introduce risk. This process maintains a robust chain of trust over time, enabling the secure evolution of the ML system while preserving user privacy and device security.</p>
<p>While Secure Boot provides strong protection, its adoption presents technical and operational challenges. Managing the cryptographic keys used to sign and verify system components is complex, especially at scale. Enterprises must securely provision, rotate, and revoke keys, ensuring that no trusted root is compromised. Any such breach would undermine the entire security chain.</p>
<p>Performance is also a consideration. Verifying signatures during the boot process introduces latency, typically on the order of tens to hundreds of milliseconds per component. Although acceptable in many applications, these delays may be problematic for real-time or power-constrained systems. Developers must also ensure that all components, including bootloaders, firmware, kernels, drivers, and even ML models, are correctly signed. Integrating third-party software into a Secure Boot pipeline introduces additional complexity.</p>
<p>Some systems limit user control in favor of vendor-locked security models, restricting upgradability or customization. In response, open-source bootloaders like <a href="https://source.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot">u-boot</a> and <a href="https://www.coreboot.org/">coreboot</a> have emerged, offering Secure Boot features while supporting extensibility and transparency. To further scale trusted device deployments, emerging industry standards such as the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/dice-device-identifier-composition-engine/">Device Identifier Composition Engine (DICE)</a> and <a href="https://1.ieee802.org/security/802-1ar/">IEEE 802.1AR IDevID</a> provide mechanisms for secure device identity, key provisioning, and cross-vendor trust assurance.</p>
<p>Secure Boot, when implemented carefully and complemented by trusted hardware and secure software update processes, forms the backbone of system integrity for embedded and distributed ML. It provides the assurance that the machine learning model running in production is not only the correct version, but is also executing in a known-good environment, anchored to hardware-level trust.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-hardware-security-modules-4377">Hardware Security Modules</h4>
<p>While TEEs and secure boot provide runtime isolation and integrity verification, Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) specialize in the cryptographic operations that underpin these protections. An HSM<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a> is a tamper-resistant physical device designed to perform cryptographic operations and securely manage digital keys. HSMs are widely used across security-important industries such as finance, defense, and cloud infrastructure, and they are increasingly relevant for securing the machine learning pipeline—particularly in deployments where key confidentiality, model integrity, and regulatory compliance are important.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn55"><p><sup>55</sup>&nbsp;<strong>HSM Performance</strong>: Enterprise HSMs can perform 10,000+ RSA-2048 operations per second but cost $20,000-$100,000+ per unit. In contrast, software-only cryptography on GPUs achieves 100,000+ operations/second at $1,000+ hardware cost, but without the tamper-resistance and regulatory compliance that HSMs provide.</p></div></div><p>HSMs provide an isolated, hardened environment for performing sensitive operations such as key generation, digital signing, encryption, and decryption. Unlike general-purpose processors, they are engineered to withstand physical tampering and side-channel attacks, and they typically include protected storage, cryptographic accelerators, and internal audit logging. HSMs may be implemented as standalone appliances, plug-in modules, or integrated chips embedded within broader systems.</p>
<p>In machine learning systems, HSMs enhance security across several dimensions. They are commonly used to protect encryption keys associated with sensitive data that may be processed during training or inference. These keys might encrypt data at rest in model checkpoints or allow secure transmission of inference requests across networked environments. By ensuring that the keys are generated, stored, and used exclusively within the HSM, the system minimizes the risk of key leakage, unauthorized reuse, or tampering.</p>
<p>HSMs also play a role in maintaining the integrity of machine learning models. In many production pipelines, models must be signed before deployment to ensure that only verified versions are accepted into runtime environments. The signing keys used to authenticate models can be stored and managed within the HSM, providing cryptographic assurance that the deployed artifact is authentic and untampered. Similarly, secure firmware updates and configuration changes, regardless of whether they pertain to models, hyperparameters, or supporting infrastructure, can be validated using signatures produced by the HSM.</p>
<p>In addition to protecting inference workloads, HSMs can be used to secure model training. During training, data may originate from distributed and potentially untrusted sources. HSM-backed protocols can help ensure that training pipelines perform encryption, integrity checks, and access control enforcement securely and in compliance with organizational or legal requirements. In regulated industries such as healthcare and finance, such protections are often mandatory. For instance, HIPAA requires covered entities to implement technical safeguards including “integrity controls” and “encryption and decryption,” while GDPR mandates pseudonymization and encryption as examples of appropriate technical measures.</p>
<p>Despite these benefits, incorporating HSMs into embedded or resource-constrained ML systems introduces several trade-offs. First, HSMs are specialized hardware components and often come at a premium. Their cost may be justified in data center settings or safety-important applications but can be prohibitive for low-margin embedded products or wearables. Physical space is also a concern. Embedded systems often operate under strict size, weight, and form factor constraints, and integrating an HSM may require redesigning circuit layouts or sacrificing other functionality.</p>
<p>From a performance standpoint, HSMs introduce latency, particularly for operations like key exchange, signature verification, or on-the-fly decryption. In real-time inference systems, including autonomous vehicles, industrial robotics, and live translation devices, these delays can affect responsiveness. While HSMs are typically optimized for cryptographic throughput, they are not general-purpose processors, and offloading secure operations must be carefully coordinated.</p>
<p>Power consumption is another concern. The continuous secure handling of keys, signing of transactions, and cryptographic validations can consume more power than basic embedded components, impacting battery life in mobile or remote deployments.</p>
<p>Integration complexity also grows when HSMs are introduced into existing ML pipelines. Interfacing between the HSM and the host processor requires dedicated APIs and often specialized software development. Firmware and model updates must be routed through secure, signed channels, and update orchestration must account for device-specific key provisioning. These requirements increase the operational burden, especially in large deployments.</p>
<p>Scalability presents its own set of challenges. Managing a distributed fleet of HSM-equipped devices requires secure provisioning of individual keys, secure identity binding, and coordinated trust management. In large ML deployments, including fleets of smart sensors or edge inference nodes, ensuring uniform security posture across all devices is nontrivial.</p>
<p>Finally, the use of HSMs often requires organizations to engage in certification and compliance processes<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a>, particularly when handling regulated data. Meeting standards such as FIPS 140-2<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a> or Common Criteria adds time and cost to development.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn56"><p><sup>56</sup>&nbsp;<strong>HSM Certification</strong>: Hardware Security Module certification under FIPS 140-2 or Common Criteria can take 12-24 months and cost $500,000-$2 million. However, many regulated industries require these certifications, with banking, government, and healthcare sectors mandating Level 3+ certified HSMs for cryptographic operations.</p></div><div id="fn57"><p><sup>57</sup>&nbsp;<strong>FIPS 140-2 Standard</strong>: Federal Information Processing Standard for cryptographic modules, established in 2001 with four security levels. Level 4 HSMs must survive physical attacks, operating at -40°C to +85°C with tamper detection that zeroizes keys within seconds, making them suitable for the most sensitive ML applications. Access to the HSM is typically restricted to a small set of authorized personnel, which can complicate development workflows and slow iteration cycles.</p></div></div><p>Despite these operational complexities, HSMs remain a valuable option for machine learning systems that require high assurance of cryptographic integrity and access control. When paired with TEEs, secure boot, and software-based defenses, HSMs contribute to a multilayered security model that spans hardware, system software, and ML runtime.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-physical-unclonable-functions-6533">Physical Unclonable Functions</h4>
<p>Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs)<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a> provide a hardware-intrinsic mechanism for cryptographic key generation and device authentication by leveraging physical randomness in semiconductor fabrication <span class="citation" data-cites="gassend2002silicon">(<a href="#ref-gassend2002silicon" role="doc-biblioref">Gassend et al. 2002</a>)</span>. Unlike traditional keys stored in memory, a PUF generates secret values based on microscopic variations in a chip’s physical properties—variations that are inherent to manufacturing processes and difficult to clone or predict, even by the manufacturer.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn58"><p><sup>58</sup>&nbsp;<strong>PUF Market Growth</strong>: The PUF market is projected to reach $320 million by 2025, driven by IoT security needs. Major semiconductor companies including Intel, Xilinx, and Synopsis now offer PUF IP, with deployment in smart cards, automotive ECUs, and edge ML devices requiring device-unique authentication.</p></div><div id="ref-gassend2002silicon" class="csl-entry" role="listitem">
Gassend, Blaise, Dwaine Clarke, Marten van Dijk, and Srinivas Devadas. 2002. <span>“Silicon Physical Random Functions.”</span> In <em>Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security - CCS ’02</em>, 148–60.

</div></div><p>These variations arise from uncontrollable physical factors such as doping concentration, line edge roughness, and dielectric thickness. As a result, even chips fabricated with the same design masks exhibit small but measurable differences in timing, power consumption, or voltage behavior. PUF circuits amplify these variations to produce a device-unique digital output. When a specific input challenge is applied to a PUF, it generates a corresponding response based on the chip’s physical fingerprint. Because these characteristics are effectively impossible to replicate, the same challenge will yield different responses across devices.</p>
<p>This challenge-response mechanism allows PUFs to serve several cryptographic purposes. They can be used to derive device-specific keys that never need to be stored externally, reducing the attack surface for key exfiltration. The same mechanism also supports secure authentication and attestation, where devices must prove their identity to trusted servers or hardware gateways. These properties make PUFs a natural fit for machine learning systems deployed in embedded and distributed environments.</p>
<p>In ML applications, PUFs offer unique advantages for securing resource-constrained systems. For example, consider a smart camera drone that uses onboard computer vision to track objects. A PUF embedded in the drone’s processor can generate a private key to encrypt the model during boot. Even if the model were extracted, it would be unusable on another device lacking the same PUF response. That same PUF-derived key could also be used to watermark the model parameters, creating a cryptographically verifiable link between a deployed model and its origin hardware. If the model were leaked or pirated, the embedded watermark could help prove the source of the compromise.</p>
<p>PUFs also support authentication in distributed ML pipelines. If the drone offloads computation to a cloud server, the PUF can help verify that the drone has not been cloned or tampered with. The cloud backend can issue a challenge, verify the correct response from the device, and permit access only if the PUF proves device authenticity. These protections enhance trust not only in the model and data, but in the execution environment itself.</p>
<p>The internal operation of a PUF is illustrated in <a href="#fig-pfu" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;17</a>. At a high level, a PUF accepts a challenge input and produces a unique response determined by the physical microstructure of the chip <span class="citation" data-cites="gao2020physical">(<a href="#ref-gao2020physical" role="doc-biblioref">Gao, Al-Sarawi, and Abbott 2020</a>)</span>. Variants include optical PUFs, in which the challenge consists of a light pattern and the response is a speckle image, and electronic PUFs such as Arbiter PUFs (APUFs), where timing differences between circuit paths produce a binary output. Another common implementation is the SRAM PUF, which exploits the power-up state of uninitialized SRAM cells: due to threshold voltage mismatch, each cell tends to settle into a preferred value when power is first applied. These response patterns form a stable, reproducible hardware fingerprint.</p>

<p>Despite their promise, PUFs present several challenges in system design. Their outputs can be sensitive to environmental variation, such as changes in temperature or voltage, which can introduce instability or bit errors in the response. To ensure reliability, PUF systems must often incorporate error correction codes or helper data schemes. Managing large sets of challenge-response pairs also raises questions about storage, consistency, and revocation. Additionally, the unique statistical structure of PUF outputs may make them vulnerable to machine learning-based modeling attacks if not carefully shielded from external observation.</p>
<p>From a manufacturing perspective, incorporating PUF technology can increase device cost or require additional layout complexity. While PUFs eliminate the need for external key storage, thereby reducing long-term security risk and provisioning cost, they may require calibration and testing during fabrication to ensure consistent performance across environmental conditions and device aging.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Physical Unclonable Functions remain a compelling building block for securing embedded machine learning systems. By embedding hardware identity directly into the chip, PUFs support lightweight cryptographic operations, reduce key management burden, and help establish root-of-trust anchors in distributed or resource-constrained environments. When integrated thoughtfully, they complement other hardware-assisted security mechanisms such as Secure Boot, TEEs, and HSMs to provide defense-in-depth across the ML system lifecycle.</p>

<p>Hardware-assisted security mechanisms play a foundational role in establishing trust within modern machine learning systems. While software-based defenses offer flexibility, they ultimately rely on the security of the hardware platform. As machine learning workloads increasingly operate on edge devices, embedded platforms, and untrusted infrastructure, hardware-backed protections become important for maintaining system integrity, confidentiality, and trust.</p>
<p>Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) provide runtime isolation for model inference and sensitive data handling. Secure Boot enforces integrity from power-on, ensuring that only verified software is executed. Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) offer tamper-resistant storage and cryptographic processing for secure key management, model signing, and firmware validation. Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) bind secrets and authentication to the physical characteristics of a specific device, enabling lightweight and unclonable identities.</p>
<p>These mechanisms address different layers of the system stack, ranging from initialization and attestation to runtime protection and identity binding, and complement one another when deployed together. <a href="#tbl-hw-security-comparison" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;9</a> below compares their roles, use cases, and trade-offs in machine learning system design.</p>

<!-- ### Toward Trustworthy Systems {#sec-security-privacy-toward-trustworthy-systems-1e6d}

Defending machine learning systems against adversarial threats, misuse, and system compromise requires more than isolated countermeasures. As this section has shown, effective defense emerges from the careful integration of mechanisms at multiple layers of the ML stack—from privacy-preserving data handling and robust model design to runtime monitoring and hardware-enforced isolation. No single component can provide complete protection; instead, a trustworthy system is the result of coordinated design decisions that address risk across the data, model, system, and infrastructure layers.

Defensive strategies must align with the deployment context and threat model. What is appropriate for a public cloud API may differ from the requirements of an embedded medical device or a fleet of edge-deployed sensors. Design choices must balance security, performance, and usability, recognizing that protections often introduce operational trade-offs. Monitoring and incident response mechanisms ensure resilience during live operation, while hardware-based roots of trust ensure system integrity even when higher layers are compromised.

As machine learning continues to expand into safety-important, privacy-sensitive, and decentralized environments, the need for robust, end-to-end defense becomes increasingly urgent. Building ML systems that are not only accurate, but secure, private, and auditable, is core to long-term deployment success and public trust.

The technical defenses we've established here form the foundation for the broader robustness framework explored in @sec-robust-ai. While this chapter has focused on protecting against malicious attacks and privacy breaches, @sec-robust-ai extends these concepts to ensure system-wide reliability under all forms of stress—from natural distribution shifts to hardware failures. The adversarial training techniques introduced here for security become part of a comprehensive robustness strategy that includes uncertainty quantification, out-of-distribution detection, and graceful degradation. Similarly, the monitoring infrastructure we've established for security incident detection provides the foundation for the broader observability systems required for robust AI deployment.

These security and privacy foundations also connect directly to the operational practices detailed in @sec-ml-operations, which provides the frameworks for implementing these protections at scale. The energy and computational overhead of security measures must be considered within the sustainability frameworks explored in @sec-sustainable-ai, and the broader ethical implications connect to the responsible AI practices covered in @sec-responsible-ai.

The process of engineering trustworthy ML systems requires a structured approach that applies the layered defense principles established earlier to specific deployment contexts. @fig-trustworthy-ml-recipe provides a practical framework to guide this process across technical and deployment dimensions. The design flow begins with a thorough assessment of the threat model and deployment context, which informs the selection of appropriate defenses from our established stack. This includes data-layer protections such as differential privacy (DP), federated learning (FL), and encryption; model-layer defenses like robustness techniques, watermarking, and secure deployment practices; runtime-layer measures such as input validation and output monitoring; and hardware-layer solutions including TEEs, secure boot, and PUFs.

**Trustworthy ML System Design**: Engineering secure and private machine learning systems requires a layered approach, integrating defenses at the data, model, runtime, and hardware levels to mitigate evolving threats and ensure responsible deployment. This design flow connects threat modeling with practical safeguards, enabling robust and auditable ML solutions for safety-important applications.
:::

This design flow emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive approach to security, where each layer of the system is fortified against potential threats while remaining adaptable to evolving risks. By integrating these principles into the design and deployment of machine learning systems, organizations can build solutions that are not only effective but also resilient, trustworthy, and aligned with ethical standards.

### Defense Selection Framework {#sec-security-privacy-defense-selection-framework-320b}

Given the breadth of security mechanisms presented, practitioners require systematic methods for selecting appropriate defenses. The choice depends on multiple interacting factors that must be evaluated holistically rather than in isolation.

Step 1: Threat Model Assessment

Begin by characterizing potential adversaries and their capabilities:

- **Who are the adversaries?** Nation-states possess unlimited resources and advanced capabilities. Competitors seek intellectual property and strategic advantages. Curious users probe for vulnerabilities. Insider threats combine access with intent. Each adversary type demands different defensive priorities.

- **What capabilities do they have?** White-box attackers with full model access require different defenses than black-box attackers limited to API queries. Physical access enables hardware attacks that remote adversaries cannot execute. Understanding attacker capabilities determines which defense mechanisms provide meaningful protection versus security theater.

- **What assets require protection?** Training data privacy, model intellectual property, inference confidentiality, and system availability each require specialized defenses. Healthcare applications prioritize patient data protection (HIPAA compliance). Financial systems emphasize transaction integrity and fraud prevention. Ranking asset criticality guides defense investment.

- **What is acceptable risk?** Regulatory environments define minimum acceptable security (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS). Reputational considerations establish higher bars—a data breach that is legally permissible may still be commercially devastating. Risk tolerance determines how much performance degradation and development cost organizations accept for security gains.

Step 2: Deployment Context Constraints

Security choices must respect operational realities:

- **Computational Budget:** Cloud deployments afford unlimited horizontal scaling, enabling expensive techniques like homomorphic encryption or extensive monitoring. Edge devices operate under severe constraints—secure enclaves consume precious memory, cryptographic operations drain batteries. Embedded systems may lack security hardware entirely. Defense selection must match available compute resources.

- **Latency Requirements:** Real-time applications (autonomous vehicles, industrial control) tolerate minimal latency overhead. Differential privacy and input validation must execute within millisecond budgets. Batch processing systems (training pipelines, offline analytics) can absorb expensive techniques like secure multi-party computation. Understanding latency budgets constrains feasible defenses.

- **Update Frequency:** Continuously learning systems require runtime security that adapts as models evolve. Static deployments can rely on one-time hardening (model encryption, watermarking). Over-the-air update capabilities enable security patches but introduce new attack surfaces. Update patterns determine whether defenses must be dynamic or can be baked-in.

- **Physical Security:** Data center deployments assume physical security and focus on logical defenses. Field-deployed devices face physical threats (tampering, extraction) requiring hardware security modules and tamper-evident packaging. Public-facing kiosks need different protections than secured facilities.

Step 3: Regulatory and Compliance Requirements

Legal mandates establish non-negotiable security baselines:

- **GDPR** (EU): Mandates data minimization, purpose limitation, privacy by design. Differential privacy and federated learning help demonstrate compliance. Cross-border data transfer restrictions favor on-device processing.

- **HIPAA** (Healthcare): Requires access controls, audit logging, encryption at rest and in transit. HSMs for key management and comprehensive logging become mandatory rather than optional.

- **CCPA** (California): Establishes consumer privacy rights including data deletion. Systems must support cryptographic erasure and maintain data provenance.

- **Industry Standards:** Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), and sector-specific regulations impose additional requirements. Non-compliance incurs financial penalties and operational restrictions.

Step 4: Recommended Layered Approach

Rather than selecting individual defenses, deploy coordinated protection:

1. Baseline Security (Universal): All ML systems require authentication, access control, encrypted communications (TLS), audit logging, and basic input validation. These foundational defenses cost little and prevent common attacks. Omitting them constitutes negligence.

2. Domain-Specific Controls (Context-Dependent): Healthcare systems add differential privacy for training data and TEEs for inference. Financial systems deploy HSMs for cryptographic operations and extensive transaction monitoring. Public-facing APIs implement rate limiting and behavioral analysis.

3. Layered Defenses (No Single Point of Failure): Assume each defense will be bypassed eventually. Differential privacy prevents training data extraction even if models are stolen. Input validation catches adversarial examples even if models lack robustness. Monitoring detects attacks that evade technical defenses. Redundancy ensures attack success requires compromising multiple independent layers.

4. Validation Through Red-Team Exercises: Theoretical security assessments miss practical vulnerabilities. Hire adversarial experts to attempt realistic attacks. Document failures and iterate defenses. Treat security as a continuous improvement process rather than one-time implementation.

Step 5: Trade-Off Optimization

Security is never free. Quantify costs and benefits:

- **Performance vs. Protection:** If differential privacy reduces accuracy by 5% but enables GDPR compliance, the trade-off may be mandatory. If homomorphic encryption adds 10 seconds of latency to millisecond-budget applications, alternative approaches are required.

- **Development Time vs. Risk Mitigation:** Basic security (authentication, encryption) adds weeks to development. Advanced techniques (federated learning, secure enclaves) require months of specialized engineering. Prioritize defenses by risk reduction per engineering hour.

- **Operational Overhead vs. Attack Detection:** Comprehensive monitoring adds 10-20% infrastructure cost. Intrusion detection systems generate false positives requiring investigation. Balance detection capabilities against operational burden.

The optimal security architecture emerges from systematically evaluating these factors rather than applying techniques prescriptively. Different deployment contexts demand different solutions—recognize this diversity and design accordingly. -->

: **Defense Selection Framework**: Maps deployment contexts to threat-specific defensive strategies with quantified trade-offs. The framework provides starting points for security architecture design, highlighting primary threats, recommended defense combinations, and key implementation trade-offs across common ML system deployment scenarios. Practitioners should adapt these patterns based on specific regulatory requirements, risk assessments, and operational constraints. {#tbl-defense-selection-framework}

This framework provides starting points rather than complete solutions. Real-world systems typically require combinations of defenses tailored to specific regulatory requirements, threat models, and operational constraints. Use these patterns as templates, adapting them based on risk assessments, compliance mandates, and resource availability. The baseline defenses identified in Step 1 (authentication, TLS, audit logging, input validation) apply universally and are assumed present in all deployment contexts above. -->
<!-- ### Implementation Roadmap: Securing a Production ML System {#sec-security-privacy-implementation-roadmap-securing-production-ml-system-511c-securing-production-ml-system-511c}

Securing production machine learning systems requires a systematic approach that evolves from establishing basic protections to implementing comprehensive defense mechanisms. Organizations face the challenge of protecting valuable models and sensitive data while maintaining system performance and meeting regulatory requirements. The path from an unsecured ML deployment to a robust, trustworthy system follows a natural progression through four critical phases, each building upon the security foundations established by its predecessor. This roadmap provides the security-specific implementation details that complement the broader operational frameworks presented in @sec-ml-operations, where these protections are integrated into continuous deployment pipelines, monitoring systems, and incident response workflows.

The journey begins with foundational security controls that provide immediate risk reduction across all ML deployments. Access control mechanisms form the first line of defense, determining who can interact with ML infrastructure and at what level. Organizations typically leverage existing identity providers like Active Directory or OAuth 2.0 to implement role-based access control, ensuring data scientists can train models while limiting production access to authorized deployment systems. Communication security follows, with TLS 1.3 or newer protocols protecting all ML API endpoints from eavesdropping and tampering. This encryption layer becomes particularly critical when models process sensitive data or operate across untrusted networks. Input validation and rate limiting at inference endpoints prevent both accidental misuse and intentional abuse, using API gateways to enforce schema validation and throttle excessive requests. Finally, comprehensive audit logging creates the forensic trail necessary for security monitoring and compliance reporting, capturing all model access, training operations, and data transformations in centralized systems like ELK stack or Splunk.

Once these foundations are established, typically within the first two weeks of implementation, organizations progress to data privacy protections that address regulatory requirements and ethical obligations. This phase begins with comprehensive data classification, cataloging all training and inference data sources to identify sensitive information such as personally identifiable information, protected health information, or financial records. For datasets containing sensitive information, differential privacy techniques add calibrated noise during training, with privacy budgets carefully selected based on regulatory requirements—typically ε ≤ 4 for general compliance and ε ≤ 1 for highly sensitive medical or financial data. When multiple organizations need to collaborate without sharing raw data, federated learning enables distributed training with secure aggregation protocols ensuring individual contributions remain private. Data minimization practices complement these technical measures by establishing retention policies that automatically delete sensitive training data after model completion, reducing the window of exposure for potential breaches.

The third phase shifts focus to protecting the models themselves as valuable intellectual property that may encode sensitive information or competitive advantages. Model encryption using AES-256 or stronger algorithms protects stored models from unauthorized access, with key management systems like AWS KMS or HashiCorp Vault ensuring proper key rotation and access control. For particularly sensitive applications, deployment within trusted execution environments provides hardware-enforced isolation, preventing even privileged system administrators from accessing model internals during inference. Organizations implement model watermarking techniques to embed undetectable ownership markers that survive model extraction attempts, while query monitoring systems detect suspicious patterns that might indicate ongoing theft attempts. Critical applications require adversarial robustness through specialized training techniques, using methods like Projected Gradient Descent to create models that maintain accuracy even when facing malicious inputs designed to cause misclassification.

The final phase establishes continuous monitoring and response capabilities that maintain security throughout the system's operational lifetime. Real-time anomaly detection systems monitor inference patterns, input distributions, and model confidence scores to identify potential attacks or system degradation. When threats are detected, automated response systems implement immediate countermeasures such as rate limiting suspicious users, isolating potentially compromised models, or escalating alerts to security teams. Performance monitoring ensures security measures don't degrade business operations, tracking metrics like inference latency and model accuracy to maintain the delicate balance between protection and utility. Comprehensive incident response procedures specific to ML systems enable rapid reaction to security events, including capabilities for model rollback to known-good versions, forensic data collection for post-incident analysis, and threat intelligence gathering to prevent future attacks.

Success metrics should guide implementation effectiveness: (1) Zero security incidents involving data leakage or model theft; (2) <5% model performance degradation from security measures; (3) 100% compliance with relevant regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, SOX); (4) <100ms additional latency from security overhead.

Implementation prioritization becomes critical for resource-constrained organizations. Start with high-impact, low-effort baseline defenses (TLS, authentication, logging) before progressing to specialized techniques. Focus on regulatory compliance requirements first (HIPAA differential privacy, GDPR data minimization) as these often have legal deadlines. Deploy privacy-preserving techniques based on data sensitivity—use differential privacy for PII/PHI, federated learning for cross-organizational collaboration, and synthetic data for lower-sensitivity use cases.

::: {.callout-warning title="Troubleshooting Guide: Common ML Security Issues" icon=false}
Issue 1: Model Performance Degradation After Security Implementation

*Symptoms*: Model accuracy drops significantly after applying differential privacy, adversarial training, or encryption.

*Root Causes*:

- Excessive noise injection (ε too small in differential privacy)
- Insufficient adversarial training budget
- Inappropriate cryptographic operations breaking model computation

*Diagnostics*:
```python
# Check DP noise impact
def measure_privacy_utility_tradeoff(model, data, epsilon_values):
    results = {}
    for eps in epsilon_values:
        dp_model = apply_differential_privacy(model, epsilon=eps)
        accuracy = evaluate_model(dp_model, data)
        results[eps] = accuracy
    return results


# Test different epsilon values: [0.1, 1.0, 4.0, 8.0]
# Look for sweet spot between privacy and utility
```

*Solutions*:

- **DP**: Start with ε = 8, gradually decrease while monitoring accuracy
- **Adversarial Training**: Use mixed training (70% clean, 30% adversarial examples)
- **Encryption**: Use approximate methods (quantization-friendly HE) for critical operations only

Issue 2: High Latency from Security Overhead

*Symptoms*: Inference time increases dramatically with TEEs, encryption, or secure protocols.

*Debugging Steps*:
1. Profile each security component separately
2. Identify bottlenecks (network, crypto, context switching)
3. Measure baseline vs. secured performance

*Optimization Strategies*:

- **TEE Optimization**: Batch inference calls, minimize context switches
- **Encryption**: Use hardware acceleration (AES-NI), optimize key operations
- **Network Security**: Pipeline TLS handshakes, use connection pooling

Issue 3: Adversarial Attack Detection False Positives

*Symptoms*: Legitimate inputs flagged as adversarial examples, causing service disruption.

*Tuning Approach*:
```python
# Adjust detection thresholds
def calibrate_adversarial_detector(detector, clean_data, attack_data):
    # Find threshold balancing false positive rate vs.
    # detection rate
    thresholds = np.linspace(0.1, 0.9, 20)
    for threshold in thresholds:
        fp_rate = compute_false_positive_rate(
            detector, clean_data, threshold
        )
        detection_rate = compute_detection_rate(
            detector, attack_data, threshold
        )
        print(
            f"Threshold {threshold}: FP={fp_rate:.3f}, "
            + f"Detection={detection_rate:.3f}"
        )
```

*Best Practices*:

- Set different thresholds for different input types
- Implement human-in-the-loop for borderline cases
- Use ensemble detection methods for robustness

Issue 4: Privacy Budget Exhaustion in Production

*Symptoms*: Cannot retrain models due to depleted privacy budget.

*Management Strategy*:

- Implement privacy budget monitoring and alerting
- Reserve budget for emergency retraining (20% buffer)
- Use synthetic data for non-critical model updates
- Plan budget allocation across model lifecycle

Issue 5: Federated Learning Convergence Problems

*Symptoms*: Models fail to converge or converge slowly in federated settings.

*Diagnostic Checklist*:

- Check data distribution across clients (non-IID data)
- Verify secure aggregation isn't corrupting gradients
- Monitor client participation rates and dropouts
- Analyze communication rounds and bandwidth usage

*Solutions*:

- Implement FedProx or FedAvgM for non-IID data
- Use client sampling strategies to ensure representative participation
- Add gradient compression to reduce communication overhead
- Implement client reliability scoring and failover mechanisms

<section id="sec-security-privacy-fallacies-pitfalls-0c20" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-fallacies-pitfalls-0c20">Fallacies and Pitfalls</h2>
<p>Having examined both defensive and offensive capabilities, we now address common misconceptions that can undermine security efforts. Security and privacy in machine learning systems present unique challenges that extend beyond traditional cybersecurity concerns, involving sophisticated attacks on data, models, and inference processes. The complexity of modern ML pipelines, combined with the probabilistic nature of machine learning and the sensitivity of training data, creates numerous opportunities for misconceptions about effective protection strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Fallacy:</strong> <em>Security through obscurity provides adequate protection for machine learning models.</em></p>
<p>This outdated approach assumes that hiding model architectures, parameters, or implementation details provides meaningful security protection. Modern attacks often succeed without requiring detailed knowledge of target systems, relying instead on black-box techniques that probe system behavior through input-output relationships. Model extraction attacks can reconstruct significant model functionality through carefully designed queries, while adversarial attacks often transfer across different architectures. Effective ML security requires robust defenses that function even when attackers have complete knowledge of the system, following established security principles rather than relying on secrecy.</p>
<p><strong>Pitfall:</strong> <em>Assuming that differential privacy automatically ensures privacy without considering implementation details.</em></p>
<p>Many practitioners treat differential privacy as a universal privacy solution without understanding the critical importance of proper implementation and parameter selection. Poorly configured privacy budgets can provide negligible protection while severely degrading model utility. Implementation vulnerabilities like floating-point precision issues, inadequate noise generation, or privacy budget exhaustion can completely compromise privacy guarantees. Real-world systems require careful analysis of privacy parameters, rigorous implementation validation, and ongoing monitoring to ensure that theoretical privacy guarantees translate to practical protection.</p>
<p><strong>Fallacy:</strong> <em>Federated learning inherently provides privacy protection without additional safeguards.</em></p>
<p>A related privacy misconception assumes that keeping data decentralized automatically ensures privacy protection. While federated learning improves privacy compared to centralized training, gradient and model updates can still leak significant information about local training data through inference attacks. Sophisticated adversaries can reconstruct training examples, infer membership information, or extract sensitive attributes from shared model parameters. True privacy protection in federated settings requires additional mechanisms like secure aggregation, differential privacy, and careful communication protocols rather than relying solely on data locality.</p>
<p><strong>Pitfall:</strong> <em>Treating security as an isolated component rather than a system-wide property.</em></p>
<p>Beyond specific technical misconceptions, a key architectural pitfall involves organizations that approach ML security by adding security features to individual components without considering system-level interactions and attack vectors. This piecemeal approach fails to address sophisticated attacks that span multiple components or exploit interfaces between subsystems. Effective ML security requires holistic threat modeling that considers the entire system lifecycle from data collection through model deployment and maintenance, following the threat prioritization principles established in <a href="#sec-security-privacy-threat-prioritization-framework-f2d5" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;1.4.1</a>. Security must be integrated into every stage of the ML pipeline rather than treated as an add-on feature or post-deployment consideration.</p>
<p><strong>Pitfall:</strong> <em>Underestimating the attack surface expansion in distributed ML systems.</em></p>
<p>Many organizations focus on securing individual components without recognizing how distributed ML architectures increase the attack surface and introduce new vulnerability classes. Distributed training across multiple data centers creates opportunities for man-in-the-middle attacks on gradient exchanges, certificate spoofing, and unauthorized participation in training rounds. Edge deployment multiplies endpoints that require security updates, monitoring, and incident response capabilities. Model serving infrastructure spanning multiple clouds introduces dependency chain attacks, where compromising any component in the distributed system can affect overall security. Orchestration systems, load balancers, model registries, and monitoring infrastructure each present potential entry points for sophisticated attackers. Effective distributed ML security requires thorough threat modeling that accounts for network communication security, endpoint hardening, identity management across multiple domains, and coordination of security policies across heterogeneous infrastructure components.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-security-privacy-summary-831c">Summary</h2>
<p>This chapter has explored the complex landscape of security and privacy in machine learning systems, from core threats to comprehensive defense strategies. Security and privacy represent essential requirements for deploying machine learning systems in production environments. As these systems handle sensitive data, operate across diverse platforms, and face sophisticated threats, their security posture must encompass the entire technology stack. Modern machine learning systems encounter attack vectors ranging from data poisoning and model extraction to adversarial examples and hardware-level compromises that can undermine system integrity and user trust.</p>
<p>Effective security strategies employ defense-in-depth approaches that operate across multiple layers of the system architecture. Privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy and federated learning protect sensitive data while enabling model training. Robust model design incorporates adversarial training and input validation to resist manipulation. Hardware security features provide trusted execution environments and secure boot processes. Runtime monitoring detects anomalous behavior and potential attacks during operation. These complementary defenses create resilient systems that can withstand coordinated attacks across multiple attack surfaces.</p>

<details class="callout-quiz-answer fbx-answer closebutton"><summary><strong>Self-Check: Answer 1.11</strong></summary><div>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Which of the following best describes a defense-in-depth approach in machine learning systems?</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Adding security features after deployment</li>
<li>Focusing solely on data encryption</li>
<li>Implementing multiple layers of security throughout the system</li>
<li>Relying on hardware security features exclusively</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Answer</em>: The correct answer is C. Implementing multiple layers of security throughout the system. This approach ensures comprehensive protection by addressing potential vulnerabilities at different layers. Options A, C, and D are incorrect as they represent incomplete or inadequate security strategies.</p>
<p><em>Learning Objective</em>: Understand the concept of defense-in-depth in ML systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explain the trade-offs involved in implementing privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy and federated learning in ML systems.</strong></p>
<p><em>Answer</em>: Privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy and federated learning introduce trade-offs between data protection and system performance. For example, differential privacy may reduce model accuracy due to noise addition, while federated learning can increase computational overhead and complexity. These trade-offs must be balanced against the need for privacy in sensitive applications.</p>
<p><em>Learning Objective</em>: Analyze the trade-offs of privacy-preserving techniques in ML systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>In a production ML system, which context would most likely prioritize adversarial robustness over other security concerns?</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Healthcare systems</li>
<li>Social media platforms</li>
<li>Financial systems</li>
<li>Autonomous vehicles</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Answer</em>: The correct answer is D. Autonomous vehicles. These systems require high adversarial robustness to ensure safety and reliability in dynamic environments. Options A, C, and D prioritize different security aspects such as compliance, theft prevention, and user data protection.</p>
<p><em>Learning Objective</em>: Identify context-specific security priorities in ML systems.</p></li>
