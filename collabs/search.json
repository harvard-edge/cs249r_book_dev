    "text": "What I’m Building\nThere are many excellent Colab notebooks out there for ML. So why create more?\nThe challenge is that most notebooks exist in isolation. They demonstrate a technique, but don’t connect to a broader learning journey. You finish one and wonder: What should I explore next? How does this fit into the bigger picture?\nCo-Labs are different. Each notebook is systematically aligned with the textbook chapters, designed to let you experiment with the exact concepts you just read about. When Chapter 10 explains quantization tradeoffs, there’s a Co-Lab where you can actually see what happens when you quantize a model from FP32 to INT8 to INT4. When Chapter 7 discusses memory hierarchies, there’s a Co-Lab where you can measure cache effects yourself.\nThe goal isn’t to replace the great resources that already exist. It’s to create a curated, progressive learning path that reinforces the textbook material through hands-on exploration.\n— Vijay"

A model that works perfectly in theory can fail in practice due to memory limits, latency constraints, or numerical precision. Co-Labs help you develop intuition for these algorithm-system interactions.\n\nSee the tradeoffs — How does batch size affect memory?
