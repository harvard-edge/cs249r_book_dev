    "text": "Preface\nWelcome to Machine Learning Systems with TinyML. This book is your gateway to the fast-paced world of AI systems. It is an extension of the course CS249r at Harvard University.\n\nWe aim to make this open-source book a collaborative effort that brings together insights from students, professionals, and the broader community of AI practitioners. We want to create a one-stop guide that dives deep into the nuts and bolts of AI systems and their many applications.\n\n“If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” – African Proverb\n\nThis isn’t a static textbook; it’s a living, breathing document. We’re making it open-source and continuously updated to meet the ever-changing needs of this dynamic field. Expect a rich blend of expert knowledge that guides you through the complex interplay between cutting-edge algorithms and the foundational principles that make them work. We’re setting the stage for the next big leap in AI innovation.\n\n\nWhy We Wrote This Book\nWe’re in an age where technology is always evolving. Open collaboration and sharing knowledge are the building blocks of true innovation. That’s the spirit behind this effort. We go beyond the traditional textbook model to create a living knowledge hub, so that we can all share and learn from one another.\nThe book focuses on AI systems’ principles and case studies, aiming to give you a deep understanding that will help you navigate the ever-changing landscape of AI systems. By keeping it open, we’re not just making learning accessible but inviting new ideas and ongoing improvements. In short, we’re building a community where knowledge is free to grow and light the way forward in global AI technology.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Need to Know\nTo dive into this book, you don’t need to be an AI expert. All you need is a basic understanding of computer science concepts and a curiosity to explore how AI systems work. This is where innovation happens, and a basic grasp of programming and data structures will be your compass.\n\n\nBook Conventions\nFor details on the conventions used in this book, check out the Conventions section.\n\n\nContent Transparency Statement\nThis book is a community-driven project, with content generated collaboratively by numerous contributors over time.
