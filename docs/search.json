These quizzes are conveniently inserted at the end of every major subsection (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and so on), as illustrated in Figure 6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Quizzes are generated at the end of every section.\n\n\n\nEach quiz typically consists of 3-5 multiple-choice questions and takes only 1-2 minutes to complete. These questions are designed to assess your understanding of the material covered in the preceding section, as shown in Figure 7 (a).\nUpon submitting your answers, SocratiQ provides immediate feedback along with detailed explanations for each question, as demonstrated in Figure 7 (b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Example of AI-generated quiz questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Example of AI-generated feedback and explanations for quizzes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: SocratiQ uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to automatically generate and grade quizzes.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Learning Flow\n\nRead a section\nSelect challenging text → Ask SocratiQ for explanation\nTake the section quiz\nReview related content suggestions\nTrack progress in dashboard\n\n\n\nGetting Help with Concepts\nWhen you encounter challenging concepts, SocratiQ offers two powerful ways to get help. First, you can select any text from the textbook and ask for a detailed explanation, as demonstrated in Figure 8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Selecting specific text to ask for clarification.\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve selected the text, you can ask questions about it, and SocratiQ will provide detailed explanations based on that context, as illustrated in Figure 9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Example of how SocratiQ provides explanations based on selected text.\n\n\n\nFigure 11 shows the response for the ask in Figure 9.\nAdditionally, you can also reference Sections, as shown in Figure 10, Sub-sections and keywords directly as you converse with SocratiQ. Use the @ symbol to reference a section, sub-section or keyword. You can also click the + Context button right above the input.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Referencing different sections from the textbook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: An interactive chat session with SocratiQ, demonstrating how to get clarification on concepts.\n\n\n\nTo enhance your learning experience, SocratiQ doesn’t just answer your questions—it also suggests related content from the textbook that might be helpful for deeper understanding, as shown in Figure 12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: SocratiQ suggests related content based on your questions to help deepen your understanding.",
